268,The day it changed,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/the-day-it-changed/,"<p>How did it get to be like this? Every opinion piece, every school pickup chat, every group text eventually settles back to the same question. How did we fall this far? How did it come to this? And most worrying, what&#x2019;s next?</p><p>People have different theories about what moment was most decisive. I could be convinced that Mitch McConnell&#x2019;s refusal to vote on Merrick Garland was the decisive moment. Things were contentious before, and they were contentious afterwards, but that moment announced clearly: your democracy is no good here. We will put our finger on the scale, and we will win.</p><p>Others go much further back, all the way to the 90s, when CSPAN allowed cameras in congress. That decision led to firebrands like Newt Gingrich, who realised they could deliver barn burner speeches to entirely empty congressional chambers that played well on national television. And election ads. He was one of the first to realise it, but soon we were all Newt Gingrinch, politicians across the spectrum and people too.</p><p>Others go further back from that and blame the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987, which had previously required that differing viewpoints get equal airtime. These critics see a direct line between the rulings in 1987, further loosening in 2000, and their final repeal in 2011 and our fragmented and disorienting media landscape of today. I&#x2019;m inclined to believe them.</p><p>But I think the biggest moment, the one we&#x2019;ll look back and point to in the history books of the future, is also the most obvious. It&#x2019;s hiding in plain sight. Yes, we&#x2019;ve talked about it at length, and it will probably eventually eclipse World War Two as the most written about and talked about series of events in modern history, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean we&#x2019;re overselling it. On the contrary, I think the death of Donald Trump in 2020 is being undersold and not analysed deeply enough. Hear me out.</p><p>The broad brush strokes are pretty well agreed on, of course. Donald Trump got COVID in early October, along with many others in his administration. Unlike others in his administration, he had to go on a ventilator, eventually succumbing to the illness on October 6th. Mike Pence was sworn in as president that day, then won election over Joe Biden a month later. Pence hasn&#x2019;t had the same cult of personality as Trump, which has weakened his standing amongst die-hard Trump supporters but also weakened the attacks from the political left. And now here we are, the Covid emergency is over, the 2024 elections are taking shape, the stock market seems to be rebounding, and things seem ok overall. Certainly less chaotic than when Trump was alive. So what&#x2019;s the problem? Let&#x2019;s imagine how things might have gone differently.</p><h3 id=""ukraine"">Ukraine</h3><p>It used to be that the left wanted peace and the right was more likely to want to spread democracy, which is why Russia&#x2019;s romp in Ukraine was such a shock to see. Putin placed a big bet on the idea that America was tired of being the policeman of the world, and he was rewarded handsomely for it. Crimea was a warning shot, and the annexation of Ukraine shows that the kind of peace we took for granted for decades may not return for a generation for more.</p><h3 id=""taiwan"">Taiwan</h3><p>As of this writing, Taiwan is still self-governed. It helps that they&#x2019;re such a powerhouse for chips, something that no one can afford to disrupt. But check in with me in five years. We&#x2019;ll draw a direct line from Trump to Pence to Kiev to Taipei in the future, mark my words.</p><h3 id=""climate-change"">Climate change</h3><p>Biden had a steep hill to climb to deliver on his climate promises. First he had to win the presidency, which obviously he did not do. Then he&#x2019;d have had to win the Senate, which was always out of reach. Then he&#x2019;d need to swing the House, which we saw wasn&#x2019;t achievable either. Then he&#x2019;d have to start the hard work of actually governing the big tent that makes up the modern Democratic Party.</p><p>But assuming he had run the table and actually gotten into a position to deliver on climate change, his Build Back Better plans were swinging for the fences. Even if he had gotten 80%, or heck, 50% of what he wanted, it&#x2019;d have marked a monumental shift in how America addresses the economy of the future, and climate change. Pence, surprising no one, hasn&#x2019;t made this a priority. So we lose another 4 or 8 years on a challenge we&#x2019;re already not meeting.</p><h3 id=""the-supreme-court"">The Supreme Court</h3><p>Roe v Wade was always going to be struck down, no matter who was president. But swapping an old far-right judge for a young, and much more radical one was only possible with a Republican Senate and White House. (Or, let&#x2019;s be clear, a Republican Senate Majority Leader who is comfortable openly defying the constitution and the president, as we do) The split on the Supreme Court is now 6-3 and as radical as it&#x2019;s ever been. I don&#x2019;t expect this to change in my lifetime. Worse, I expect to see 8-1 instead.</p><h3 id=""the-cult-of-trump-continues"">The cult of Trump continues</h3><p>Trump has become the new JFK. Worse, he&#x2019;s become the new messiah. Before Trump&#x2019;s death, his followers were fervent. Somehow they&#x2019;ve found a new gear, and they seem ready to make him a much bigger figure than Reagan ever was. It&#x2019;s not uncommon to see Trump posters hanging beside Jim Morrison, Snoop Dogg, and Kurt Cobain. At first I thought they were ironic, but now I&#x2019;m not so sure. Trump seems destined to be remembered as more James Dean or Johnny Rotten than anything resembling who he really was in life. That won&#x2019;t end well.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>I haven&#x2019;t even touched on Waco, the Unabomber, the 2000 election, Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s emails, or dozens of other moments in history that led to where we are and where we&#x2019;re heading as a country and planet. We can quibble over which was worse for the republic, Benghazi or Whitewater, Nader or Bernie, the far left or the centrists, or hundreds of other things. But for my vote, the death of Trump in 2020 moved the world from tottering and precariously balanced to something far darker. We&#x2019;ll feel the reverberations as long as we live.</p>",2023-06-19 21:02:48,üí¨,4176-068c
395,Proud of this new feature,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/proud-of-this-new-feature/,"<p>To explain the new feature I just added to my blog, I&#x2019;m just going to copy/paste what I wrote to my friend.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>So, like, most blogs do this:</p><p>site.com/blog/1</p><p>site.com/blog/2</p><p>Which is fine.</p><p>They also load everything in pure chronological order. And that&#x2019;s fine too. They also do reverse chron feeds. Fine. But that means that when you link directly to a blog post, there&#x2019;s a list of categories, forward and backward buttons, and so forth. The whole thing is CRUD. Fine.</p><p>My goal was that I want to do a firehose to take from lots of different feeds.</p><p>And I want everything to get stored away into a single database, so if a feed goes kaput, I don&#x2019;t lose my data. Because it was all saved in a DB. Woo.</p><p>So if I were to make an RSS feed of something like that, where should the links go to? I could point to the original source, like Medium or whatever. But I really want to link to the firehose itself. So the urls can still be:</p><p>firehose.com/1/</p><p>firehose.com/2/</p><p>Even though those two posts originally came from a different place. BUT</p><p>I am not writing a blog. I do not want to provide a stream of everything, other than in the RSS. I want to provide a permalink to an essay, and I want that essay to be an island. You can read this essay, but none of the other ones. Why should reading one necessarily have a link to the one before it or the one after it? That&#x2019;s CRUD thinking.</p><p>So I needed a &#x201C;slug&#x201D; for the URL, so you can go to</p><p>firehose.com/&lt;random string&gt;</p><p>So I got it working and I am pleased about it</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>If you&#x2019;re reading this in an RSS reader, try clicking through to the link. In the past, it would have pointed to the permalink on Ghost. But now it&#x2019;s pointing to my own site. Complete with a visual makeover!</p><p>I&#x2019;m pleased about this, yay me!</p>",2024-03-17 05:13:33,üí¨,yzc2-9wsh

104,Faster iterations mean faster improvement,https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=51169,"
<p>Many years ago, programmers would have to submit applications on punch cards. That's well before my time, so I don't know how that must have felt. But I can imagine you'd spend a lot longer trying to make sure everything looked exactly right. I can imagine it'd be agonising waiting to get your results back. And gosh, imagine how disappointing it would be to get your results and find you made a minor typo. Ugh!</p>
<p>On the other hand, the 2023 experience is so fast it almost doesn't feel real. You can type something in your editor and it will immediately tell you when there's an error. You can hit save and (in the case of React) the browser will automatically update within a moment or two. We're getting closer and closer to coding feeling like sculpture. As Bret Victor famously says, if you can see the results of your actions immediately, entirely new ways of thinking and creating open up.</p>
<p>I just spent a few hours fixing some bugs, and I saw a different sort of iteration process, but just as profound:</p>
<ol>
<li>Figure out the thing I want to add/improve</li>
<li>Search for the information</li>
<li>Deploy it</li>
</ol>
<p>Those three steps don't seem like much, and in a way they're not. We've always done step #1 and step #3. It's step #2 that's been the hard part. Google search results can be helpful, as can docs and Stack Overflow questions. But they often take a lot of effort to get working well. Stack Overflow answers can be good, but sometimes your question is different enough that previous questions won't help. Google can point you to answers, but they're often outdated or bad. Documentation can help but only if it's good, up-to-date, and you are the sort of person that can find what you need in docs.</p>
<p>In comparison, chatGPT just lets me get the information. My step #2 has just gotten much, much faster. So I see myself improving much, much faster.</p>

419,Elementary particles of truth,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/elementary-particles-of-truth/,"<p>I have a friend who uses the term &#x201C;elementary particles of meaning&#x201D; to refer to things that are foundationally true for a person. For example, you might say you enjoy biking. Why? Because you like the exercise. Why? Because you feel better when you do. Why? Not sure! It&#x2019;s a foundational thing. Or maybe you feel that way about understanding the mysteries of the universe. Why do you want to know? You just do. It&#x2019;s just how you find meaning.</p><p>I like thinking about debate in a similar way. I like the line &#x201C;you&#x2019;re entitled to your own opinions, but not to your own facts.&#x201D; You can believe that the sky is made of marmalade, but it&#x2019;s not. You can believe that 2+2 equals 5, but it doesn&#x2019;t. There are core things in a debate that can be proven or disproven, but they are often in the mix against a whole bunch of value judgements and opinion.</p><p>There are many websites that have attempted to provide a better place for reasonable debate. I started a little non-profit in 2020 for fighting disinformation, and as part of that work I met with fellow founders trying to tackle this problem. I have studied a bunch of sites old and new that have taken on the challenge. One of my favourite experiences is on a site I&#x2019;ve since forgotten, where a debate went like this:</p><p>Person A: Gun violence is out of control in America, and therefore we need more restrictions on guns.</p><p>Person B: I agree that there are a lot of gun deaths, and even one is too many. But did you know 60% of gun violence deaths are suicide?</p><p>Person A: I did not know that. The numbers are still too high, though. America is uniquely violent.</p><p>Person B: I don&#x2019;t disagree, but do you know about knife violence in the UK? It&#x2019;s at 85 incidents per 100,000 population. America&#x2019;s gun violence is about 5 per 100,000 population.</p><p>Person A: I didn&#x2019;t know that, but &#x201C;incidents&#x201D; is very different from &#x201C;deaths.&#x201D; If you run the numbers for knife deaths in the UK, it&#x2019;s down at 0.41 per 100,000, compared to the US at 5 per 100,000, which is a lot different.</p><p>And on they went! This was all real data, with both sides attempting to keep an open mind, and where possible basing their opinions on facts. It was enjoyable to read, and gratifying to see it is possible.</p><hr><p>I&#x2019;ve recently started talking with someone on the internet. We agree on some things, disagree on other things, and are both claiming to have open, curious, fair minds in a debate format. We started things off with &#x201C;Did Russia interfere with the US election in 2016?&#x201D;</p><p>Person A: If you look at the total amount of money spent by the troll army controlled by Putin&#x2019;s Chef, it&#x2019;s negligible. Less than $100k. Basically rounds to zero if you compare it to how much the campaigns themselves spent.</p><p>Person B: Right, but the troll army isn&#x2019;t the entirety of the attack. The GRU, Wikileaks, etc were apparently part of the attack. We can&#x2019;t know with great certainty exactly who said what to whom, but at a high level the Wikipedia page on Russian interference describes a lot more than $100k of wasted Facebook ads.</p><p>Person A: (This came earlier in the discussion, but I&#x2019;m writing it here for narrative structure) America clutches its pearls when other people interfere with us, but we&#x2019;ve been interfering for years! Nearly always with bad results. And let&#x2019;s say they are meddling, what should the US do, kill them?</p><p>Person B: Totally agree America interferes. Totally agree that there are a lot of bad outcomes to point to. All countries spy on each other, that&#x2019;s factored in to the way the world works. But of course proportionality matters. So expressing support for a candidate Ukraine is a much smaller slight than a state-sponsored, highly sophisticated attack on an electrical grid, for example. You wouldn&#x2019;t react to a single spy by killing a world leader.</p><p>And that&#x2019;s as far as we&#x2019;ve gotten. I think it&#x2019;s healthy and good that we&#x2019;re referring to facts where possible. And we both know that even when looking at the same facts, we may land on different conclusions or opinions. That&#x2019;s fine. But I do believe there are elementary particles of truth that discussions rely on, and I believe there are people in the world who are interested in them.</p>",2024-03-20 04:13:34,üí¨,o573-s7j0
325,Gaza,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/gaza/,"<p>We&#x2019;re witnessing a new wedge issue, and it&#x2019;s sizing up to be a doozy. I&#x2019;ve been debating Israel/Palestine for decades, and I find it helps to start with common ground. Here are some things that anyone would agree with:<br></p><ul><li>Hamas butchered innocent civilians in a horrible terrorist attack</li><li>Innocent civilians have died in Gaza, which is also horrible</li><li>Hamas also took a lot of hostages</li><li>Israel has a right to defend itself and get their people back</li><li>War has rules, and Israel should follow them</li><li>Hamas is a terrorist organisation that uses civilians as human shields</li></ul><p>And this is where things get fuzzier. Some people lean harder on the side of &#x201C;there is a humanitarian crisis, therefore an immediate cease fire is required.&#x201D; Others might counter &#x201C;there are still hostages being held, and getting them back is any country&#x2019;s highest priority.&#x201D; Some people argue that Israel is purposely targeting civilians, others counter that Hamas purposely embeds itself to maximise civilian casualties.</p><p>Right now, the &#x201C;hearts and minds&#x201D; battle is decisively on the side of the Palestinians, and by extension, Hamas. Israel badly misstepped when some idiot in their government said &#x201C;there are no innocents in Gaza.&#x201D; Israel has nearly zero goodwill in the global community, even before that ghoulish statement, and Netanyahu is barely even a legitimate president. As a result of this untrustworthy and bloodthirsty government, we&#x2019;re seeing a massive spike in antisemitic behaviour against normal civilians around the world. This is awful. Being Jewish doesn&#x2019;t mean you deserve the hate and scorn of the entire world, but that&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;re seeing. It&#x2019;s a nightmare, and it&#x2019;s sad.</p><p>I feel like I have a pretty consistent point of view about civilians:</p><ul><li>What Russia is doing will go down in history as a Hitler-esque, barbaric, immoral, subhuman campaign of rape, torture, and literal genocide.</li><li>What Hamas advocates for is the same. They seek to exterminate Jews from the face of the earth. It&#x2019;s Hitler-esque, barbaric, immoral, and subhuman. It uses rape, torture, and hopes of extermination.</li><li>When innocent kids in Gaza are killed &#x2013; for any reason, Hamas using them as shields, or Israel bombing a civilian area &#x2013;&#xA0;it&#x2019;s bad. But Israel has been clear about the moves they&#x2019;re going to make, they often call ahead before attacking an area, and they are taking important steps to reduce civilian deaths. These are not steps that Russians or Hamas are taking. Where Israel warns families to flee, Hamas and Russia are purposely deploying tactics to maximise civilian casualties.</li></ul><p>We can all agree that civilian life is sacred. But it&#x2019;s not hard to distinguish between beheading an infant as part of a terrorist military operation and a bomb that goes awry and causes innocent deaths in a war zone. It&#x2019;s not hard to distinguish between an innocent Jew and a policy set forth by the president of Israel. It&#x2019;s not hard to understand that if you care about civilians, you should probably notice how terrified our Jewish friends and neighbours are right now, for good reason. These are not complicated distinctions to make. But too many are failing to make them.</p><p>It&#x2019;s a sad time, and we&#x2019;re going to see a political realignment as a result. Here&#x2019;s my point of view: There are people calling for the elimination of Taiwan, Israel, and Ukraine as independent countries. These innocent countries are facing an existential threat from genocidal monsters who have no goals beyond pain and power. They are attempting to manipulate public opinion, but I can tell the difference between a military force on offence versus defence. I stand with the defenders, even as I encourage them to counter-attack in a way consistent with the laws of war.</p><p>To my far-left brethren out there: don&#x2019;t lose the plot. Every call for cease fire, whether in Ukraine or Gaza, is allowing the ghouls to firm up their stolen gains and prepare to attack civilians again. If you genuinely care about civilians, stop appeasing the terrorists attempting to wipe them from the face of the earth. Unless your real issue is hating Jews, in which case, carry on I guess.</p>",2023-10-31 22:45:28,üí¨,5dd5-f847

46,Getting chatGPT To Remember You,https://jonbell.medium.com/getting-chatgpt-to-remember-you-33fa9f6a1c87?source=rss-15b289981db3------2,"<h4>An easy trick for getting much better¬†results</h4><h4>The challenge</h4><p>A great assistant learns your tastes so it can get more and more accurate as it learns more things about you. But chatGPT doesn‚Äôt know who you are from session to session. On the other hand, Bing + chatGPT can read websites, meaning you can give it a personal dossier to base its results¬†on.</p><h4>Example one: what movie should I¬†watch?</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UW6M7jdLndNZlr83DlXt6g.png"" /><figcaption>chatGPT‚Äôs response</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LzqlRaHwpNxbycXPxyYc6w.png"" /><figcaption>Bing‚Äôs response</figcaption></figure><p>In this test, I asked chatGPT and Bing+chatGPT the same question. chatGPT can‚Äôt read websites so it gives me some standard suggestions. But Bing can see the note I‚Äôve written about Sophia Coppola and give me recommendations based off it. So let‚Äôs keep adding things to the¬†dossier.</p><h4>Example two: where should I¬†eat?</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*S6K7MmI7zlFy8gOxBDBh7Q.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rIw9PPKOhlXdKmKZTgfrBg.png"" /></figure><p>chatGPT would have done a lot better if I had said ‚Äúnear me in Tulsa‚Äù but it wouldn‚Äôt have known this rhetorical person was a vegetarian unless I specifically spelled it out in every search. Bing spots both details and does a great job with the¬†result.</p><h4>Example three: a present + activity for my¬†daughter</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*VwK_H5O1wdczn7KbuAv5wg.png"" /></figure><p>I‚Äôve mentioned that Sally is 9, likes Star Wars, and uses a wheelchair, so when I ask for book and activity advice, I‚Äôm told about a great book and something called ‚Äúwheelchair hiking‚Äù that is apparently popular in Tusla. Home¬†run.</p><h4>Example four: what should I¬†read?</h4><p>This was an interesting one. When I asked about books, it gave me general advice. But when I asked it to focus on this page only, it got more relevent:</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BP2w-U5wJRuYJx8Yy5JRbw.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wY9SaYm0wC52NhipGX0gpA.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0MymWpDkcDAPyTJB1iuUsg.png"" /></figure><p>When I asked to learn more about the recommendations, it explicitly talked about reviews and popularity, which is applicable to anyone. But it implicitly could tell that I wanted to hear about relationships because of the phrasing I used, and the examples I used. NANA is about two women, both named Nana, who end up becoming roommates. Notice that 2 of the 3 recommendations are about sisters who are close! Pretty¬†cool.</p><h4>Example five: now you know me better, any other¬†movies?</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OY8A6zTDwyfgEIGwOVLsZg.png"" /></figure><p>Bing + chatGPT messed up here because On the Rocks is also her movie. But other than that error, these are good insights and suggestions. Really good. Another fantastic answer. (Before Sunrise is amazing,¬†btw)</p><h4>Example six: what manga should I¬†read?</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IAaV1SBUfOprWuyH03G7PQ.png"" /></figure><p>After 11 data points, I can just say ‚Äúbased on what you know about me‚Ä¶‚Äù and get a really good answer. Note that it‚Äôs not just spotting examples of manga I mentioned, it‚Äôs specifically noting that I said I like memoirs and real-life experiences, and it‚Äôs tying that into the¬†result.</p><p>Note: I‚Äôve made up this dossier so it‚Äôs not exactly my tastes and preferences. But I‚Äôve never heard of Penguin Loves Mev before now and it actually might be right up my alley!¬†:)</p><h4>This is¬†exciting</h4><p>I was on the Windows Phone design team when we dreamed up Cortana. My very small contribution (I wasn‚Äôt formally on that team, but the people on the team were my friends/mentees) was talking about making Siri less of a black box. Those modest insights are what one day turned into Cortana Notebook.</p><p>There is no doubt in my mind that AI software will have a notebook or dossier attached to it in some way. In this example I‚Äôve hacked it together with a little webpage, but in the future it‚Äôll be a standard part of the software that everything is run¬†through.</p><p>You shouldn‚Äôt have to add ‚Äúwheelchair friendly‚Äù or ‚Äúmarried‚Äù or ‚Äúallergic to fish‚Äù or ‚Äúlives in Tulsa‚Äù or ‚Äúalready saw Avatar‚Äù or ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt listen to top 40‚Äù ever again. You should be able to explain your tastes once, and only once, and know that the recommendations are always tailor-made to¬†you.</p><p>This also means apps are dead. But that‚Äôs another¬†post.</p><img src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=33fa9f6a1c87"" width=""1"" height=""1"" alt="""">",2023-03-16 01:12:29,üìù,a51a-b035

213,Humane Wants to Go Screenless,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/humane-wants-to-go-screenless/,"<p>If you haven&#x2019;t heard, an ex-Apple employee started a company called Humane and their stealth product is a screenless device. A replacement for the phone. They want us to go screenless, but does anyone else?</p><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMsQO5u7-NQ&amp;ref=a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io"">Here&#x2019;s the demo</a>, which was announced at TED.</p><p>The idea of &#x201C;invisible&#x201D; or &#x201C;seamless&#x201D; tech is exciting, but not new. No one wants their product to require lots of mental overhead, so technology innovators have spent decades trying to figure out how to get the user interface out of the way, and we&#x2019;ve made good strides in that direction.</p><p>So the question is not whether or not we want technology to fade into the background, or be in service to us, because we all agree on that. The question is how to best deliver this experience, and Humane has announced their answer, a little projector you clip to your shirt, paired with headphones.</p><p>Before I go on, I should say that I have a reputation with my friends and coworkers for being excited about new technologies. Some people &#x2014; most people, in my experience &#x2013; are cautious about new technologies and products. I tend to be less cautious and more excited.</p><p>So speaking as someone who delights in how new ideas can change things for the better, and someone who has spent years of his career working on the very problems Humane is trying to solve, here&#x2019;s what I think: they&#x2019;re missing the bigger picture because they think screens are bad and the solution is pinning a little projector to our clothing. I believe history will prove them wrong.</p><p>Mr Chaudhri&#x2019;s demo features four things:<br></p><ul><li>Receiving a phone call without a screen (light is beamed onto his hand)</li><li>Asking for a place to shop nearby</li><li>Speaking in English and hearing it translated into another language</li><li>Holding up a candy bar and asking if he can eat it</li></ul><p>Now let&#x2019;s pull apart the technologies that are allowing this to happen:</p><ul><li>Cellular (data and voice)</li><li>GPS</li><li>AI</li><li>Language translation</li><li>Image recognition</li></ul><p>And let&#x2019;s consider the je ne sais quoi that pulls it all together. Of course it&#x2019;s amazing to not have to launch an OS, find an app, and launch it. Of course it&#x2019;s amazing to have it always listening, always viewing, and always connected. These are not a small things that you can wave away and claim that using a phone can match. An experience like this could be a real breakthrough, and that matters. But there are other things to consider, and that&#x2019;s where my educated concerns come in. I used to work on Windows Phone, where designers proposed this vision one hundred different times. But there are certain limitations that need real solutions before I can get excited:</p><ul><li>Battery life is never good</li><li>Software via voice is clumsy</li><li>Why use this if you have a phone? (and AirPods)</li></ul><p>Even if your device has infinite battery life, and even if you appreciate being able to talk to a powerful AI to answer quick questions, no one is reasonably arguing that you wouldn&#x2019;t also carry your phone. Which means you&#x2019;d be carrying your phone, plus your headphones, plus this new projector thing, at all times. And charging everything at night. And that&#x2019;s before factoring in how much it all costs, and presumably paying for a cellular plan.</p><p>That single issue is by itself a huge hurdle, and we haven&#x2019;t even gotten to battery life and clumsy audio UX yet. Unfortunately those are even harder nuts to crack. I know, because I have pitched these same concepts. One of my favourite demos from 2012 was a &#x201C;remember that&#x201D; phrase that would jump back 15 seconds in time and take an audio and video clip of whatever was just happening in a meeting, much like Humane is describing. So I get the promise. But I&#x2019;m also intimately familiar with the technological limitations getting in the way of it becoming reality.</p><p>The promise of invisible technology is wonderful. The premise of doing it with a little projector on your shirt that expects it to replace your phone is an utter non-starter.</p><p>On the other hand, if you&#x2019;re Apple, you have all the pieces to make something like this work. But guess what &#x2013; it&#x2019;s still going to involve a phone.</p><p>More accurately, an iPhone.</p>",2023-05-10 05:11:59,üí¨,63ad-452f
49,The Church of Plain Text,https://jonbell.medium.com/the-church-of-plain-text-f64fc9c33ae6?source=rss-15b289981db3------2,"<p>Every single one of my tech friends has come to the same conclusion, some quicker than others: if you write, you need to save your content in a way that can‚Äôt be locked into a proprietary format. So we spend time doing everything in Markdown, committing each file to version control, and feeling vaguely smug about ourselves as proud acolytes in the Church of Plain Text. It works for a while, but then doubt and regret sneak in. Because the fact remains that proprietary formats are actually pretty awesome for some scenarios.</p><p>Take photos, for example. Most people use something like Apple‚Äôs Photos.app or Microsoft Photos. But if you didn‚Äôt like how those apps are proprietary, you could choose to export everything into a giant folder of JPGs. And that would work for a very narrow use case, where you just wanted to see everything in a simple directory structure. But what about editing, or search, or storing things automatically in the cloud? What about adding tags or albums, easily sharing with others, or seeing metadata? None of that works. It turns out a great photo experience is a lot more than storing the photos themselves. Storage is trivial. Everything else is¬†hard.</p><p>Text has similar limitations. When I write a book, I am designing things meant to be held in your hands or read in an ebook reader. Pouring a bunch of ASCII text into a page is only about 5% of the work. Adding line numbers, inserting line, page, or chapter breaks, assigning typefaces, adjusting leading, using dropcaps, designing a cover, dealing with hyphenation rules, the list goes on and on. There‚Äôs a reason why entire suites of products exist to help people design and publish books. The Church of Plain Text is a cute idea but it doesn‚Äôt scale beyond blog¬†posts.</p><p>And it doesn‚Äôt even do those very well! What if you need to add an image to your post? With something like Medium or Microsoft Word, you can drag and drop an image directly into your canvas or press command-P to paste an image directly from your clipboard. But the Church of Plain Text makes you a) figure out a way to host the image somewhere else outside the editor window b) type some arcane commands to get the image to show up. That‚Äôs not a full credit solution. It‚Äôs a clumsy hack that only barely meets the bar for an editing experience.</p><p>Keeping things in plain text is great for some scenarios. It‚Äôs un-great for others. It‚Äôs important to be able to tell the difference between the two without getting too dogmatic about your chosen religion.</p><img src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f64fc9c33ae6"" width=""1"" height=""1"" alt="""">",2022-12-26 06:43:50,üìù,b3e7-4015

This evening, I posted a <a href=""https://firehose.lot23.com/?ref=a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io"">new version of the landing page</a>. And once I did it, I realised something for the 100th time. Something I&#x2019;ve known implicitly and explicitly, but tonight I felt it in a new way: this is a product others might like. And pay for.</p><p>Firehose is simple, but solves something I haven&#x2019;t seen anywhere else: it pulls all your content across the internet into a single place. Like if Linktree could scrape data instead of being a simple series of links.</p><p>So let&#x2019;s say you post things to your blog, but you also have a second blog, and you also post images online, but you also run a Mastodon account that talks about 80s pop culture. Firehose pulls all of that content together into one place. It makes it easier for your fans to follow everything you&#x2019;re up to, and it gives you data portability. So even if your blog goes offline, you still have all the content saved and stored.</p><p>I remember my friend Nick saying he liked the idea. But back then I wasn&#x2019;t ready to make the site work for anyone other than me. Now I&#x2019;m starting to think that&#x2019;s probably what I should do next. Maybe I can prop up John Gruber, Hank Green, and Nick Firehoses, just to see how well they work with my rickety little system. And then I can fix those issues and see what I learn.</p><p>I could this being something someday. I&#x2019;d like to keep improving to see where it goes.</p>",2024-03-24 08:43:07,üí¨,5i3p-dllo

And they‚Äôre super related to each other. Here‚Äôs some perspective to keep in¬†mind.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/568/1*BY_IGVBuJTQQDShfWTizDQ.png"" /></figure><h4>The party in power (almost) always loses the¬†midterms</h4><p>This is not unique to Biden, although Biden is uniquely unpopular in modern history. We always knew he was going to lose the House and probably also the Senate. So did Obama in his midterms. So did Trump. So did Clinton. So did Carter. George H W Bush. And so¬†forth.</p><h4><strong>Republicans won‚Äôt be able to pass¬†anything</strong></h4><p>The House and Senate work together to pass bills, then they send them to the president to sign. If the president vetoes it, they need to re-vote and collect even more votes. The Republicans don‚Äôt have a veto-proof majority. None of their substantial bills will pass. Maybe they can pass something called the ‚ÄúWe All Think Cats Are Cute‚Äù Act or something, but nothing¬†big.</p><h4><strong>People sour on the party in power¬†quickly</strong></h4><p>After two years of Republicans controlling congress, people looking for change (which tends to be the lion‚Äôs share of the voting population) will swing back to Democrats in 2024. As a Democratic strategist, you <em>want</em> the country to assosciate the GOP with ‚Äúbusiness as usual in Washington.‚Äù The absolute worst case scenario is for Democrats to be on the hook for the next two years while they‚Äôre feeling pessimistic about the¬†future.</p><h4><strong>People sour on Republicans especially quickly</strong></h4><p>This isn‚Äôt a ding or a joke, it‚Äôs just cold hard facts. Republicans don‚Äôt have a popular platform. The majority of people disagree with them on gun control, abortion rights, January 6th, same-sex marriage, stimulus checks, child tax credits, the voting rights act, the rich paying their fair share, the environment, and so forth. The Republicans have two platform planks: tax cuts, and ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not Democrats.‚Äù The novelty always wears off quickly. We‚Äôve been here¬†before.</p><h4>Infighting is a modern Republican tradition</h4><p>When they have Pelosi and a Democratic president to beat up on, the Republicans are pretty well united. But when they get power, they get very Lord of the Flies. It wasn‚Äôt always this way. They used to be good at party discipline as recently as the 90s. That‚Äôs out the window now. If you think Republicans hate Pelosi, wait until you see the existential battle between moderate and extreme Republicans in the run-up to¬†2024.</p><h4>Scared about 2024? Give the GOP enough rope to hang themselves</h4><p>I know it seems counter-intuitive, and I know it seems like winning should always be better than losing. But it‚Äôs not so when you‚Äôre dealing with the swinging pendulum of divided US politics. People hate the group in power, so it‚Äôs important to sidestep the bright spotlight periodically. Let people realize all over again why they hate Republicans, then you can sell them on the Democratic platform again. That‚Äôs how it¬†works.</p><p>So go out and vote! Get everyone you know voting! But when Democrats fall short, keep your eye on the big prize. An insane GOP is the Democrats‚Äô best hope for 2024. When Trump runs¬†again.</p><img src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=6dd0ae863a7f"" width=""1"" height=""1"" alt="""">",2022-11-08 07:20:41,üìù,bd0b-1892

277,Update from California,https://academia.lot23.com/post/31,"I have completely forgotten what I was up to with my degree! Last week, I flew to the states to do a corporate retreat in Sonoma and I'll be getting on a plane to come back home this evening. In that time, I haven't thought much about my degree, so this is me getting my brain back on track.<br /><br />*Today's my first day!*<br /><br />After months of preparation, my actual first day is actually today. I had asked for my first day to be July 1st, but that was the middle of the weekend, so they asked how I felt about the first Monday in July. And that's today, at least in New Zealand. Still Sunday here.<br /><br />*I have two weeks to finish my draft proposal!*<br /><br />My first assignment is to complete a draft of my proposal. Funnily enough, I did that work months ago when I was applying to the program. I'll need to revise it with my latest plans, but it's not a very daunting task. So that's nice.<br /><br />*I have a month to finish my final proposal!*<br /><br />I'll have two weeks after my draft proposal to incorporate feedback into a final proposal. Again, not a huge concern since I've already done and shared the work.<br /><br />*I have an (odd) email*<br /><br />When I worked at Microsoft, my email was ""jobell."" I asked on the first day if we could change it to jonbell but decided against it when I saw my manager's face fall. I could have changed it, but it would have taken weeks -- weeks I needed to have a functioning email -- so I dropped it.<br /><br />A similar thing is happening with my email for this school. I'll be ""belljona"" because their algorithm says ""last name and four letters of first name."" I asked for ""belljon"" and didn't hear back for two weeks, so I guess I'll drop it.<br /><br />*I need to stub everything out*<br /><br />I have a bunch of UI patterns I want to draw up, but I keep forgetting them. When I tell people about my program and reach for an example of a pattern, I always flail around when describing them. I think making basic versions of the 10-15 I have planned will help me get inspired and get rolling.<br /><br />*Deadlines*<br /><br />Speaking of getting rolling, I don't want to accidentally run out of time, or get stressed at the end. I want to stage things out as if I only had, say, three months. That way I'll have an MVP after 3 months and then plenty of time to edit, revise, solidify, and react to feedback. This is a technique I use a lot in life and at work, and I'm excited to aim it at my school work.<br /><br />*Thought exercise: what if I only had a month?*<br /><br />If I needed to turn in my entire paper in one month, I'd need to get to work writing so I could hit the 8k-30k deadline. That's an average of 266 words per day. But I already have a bunch written, so the number is closer to 200 words a day. Yawn, that's nothing.<br /><br />The next thing I'd do is cut back on the amount of cut I'm attempting to write from scratch. I want to have a pattern library of my own code in most cases, but if I only had a month I'd have to get by with sketches and words. That's perfectly fine. Explaining everything in textual detail before writing code is probably a good idea anyway.<br /><br />I'd also want to make sure I'm referring to enough prior work. So somewhere in there I'd need to do a literature review. I've read a lot on this topic already, both before this degree and in the last three months. So I think a lot of this work would simply be formalising all the stuff I've found already.<br /><br />And I think that'd be it! Less code, more literature review and explaining the patterns I'm proposing in detail. I think the issue will be less *reaching* 8k words and more *not exceeding* 30k words. Writing is easy, but editing is where things really shine. So I think that's my plan. I'll pretend I have a month and roughly follow this plan.<br /><br />Onward!",2023-07-02 19:38:25,üéì,e7cb-e70a
255,"10 June, 2023",https://academia.lot23.com/post/25,"It's been a big week, so I want to make sure to track everything in one place. For historical context, this was the week Apple announced Apple Vision. But for me, the big news was that I officially enrolled in grad school, and I'll be starting officially on the 1st of July. Hurray!<br /><br />Here's what's on my mind, at a high level:<br /><br />* I met with Walter<br />* I toured the school and the place where I'll be seated<br />* My research won't be as science-y as I assumed<br />* I want to make an gallery of interactive widgets<br />* Explorable Explorations will be a focus, but I'm going to make them more tangible<br />* I want a website that can show different versions of itself<br />* I want a widget for showing the last thing you viewed<br />* I want to start making a library of widget ideas so I can go make them<br />* I want to be careful with how I set off on this adventure<br />* But inspiration is important too<br /><br />###  My first chat with Walter (since enrolling)<br /><br />We went to Midnight Espresso, a favourite of mine, and got down to brass tacks. There's a checklist of items like ""do you both agree how often to meet?"" and ""does the student understand the ethical requirements for doing research?"" and that sort of thing. That stuff all made sense, but then we hit on something that fundamentally changed my trajectory as a student: Walter suggested I don't need to do the sort of research that I've been imagining, with real people in labs attempting to perform tasks.<br /><br />###  Research versus research<br /><br />I had a whole vision around interviewing 50 people after attending a lecture and 50 people after using an Explorable Explanation. I wanted to address the ""reproducibility crisis!"" I wanted to do replication studies to help solidify some of the findings in my field! I was feeling something akin to scientific patriotism. I wanted to help! I wanted to be a team player! Hurray for the pursuit of knowledge!<br /><br />But Walter reminded me that this work is about proving a mastery of a subject, in my case, design. ""Don't look backwards, help us look forwards,"" he said in several different ways. He wants me to use my experience and my knowledge to create new things to help move things forward, not spend time comparing my ideas to things in the past. Fair enough.<br /><br />As a tangible example, he described a scenario where I did an Explorable Explanation, then compared its success metrics against lectures, books, and videos. He said all that time spent rehashing educational theory probably wouldn't be a great use of time. How cool would it be, he said, if I instead  did ... two Explorable Explanations instead?<br /><br />I use a technique in a conversation sometimes, where I try to explain what I am grasping and exactly what I am struggling to understand. A few times I told Walter ""Ok, I totally understand what you are saying in the abstract. Look forward, not backward. Spend time on things that could be seen as new, rather than trying to benchmark my new ideas against old ideas. Got it. But at a tangible, tactical, deliverable level ... what are you encouraging me to do?"" I tossed out a few ideas, but he was noncommittal. ""Just don't look backwards."" It gave me a lot to think about, and I got very excited.<br /><br />###  I think I have a plan<br /><br />While in Midnight Espresso and during the drive home, I hatched a plan. Over the last few days, my enthusiasm for it has only increased, which is a good sign. So here's the pitch.<br /><br />Before I was going to say ""There's this concept called Explorable Explanations. Here's what they are. Here's what they're good at. And here's how they compare against other forms of communications.""<br /><br />Now I'm going to say ""Information needs to be contextual to communicate well. Here are examples of great information design, including Explorable Explanations. Oh, and here's a gallery of interactions, many of which will be entirely novel.<br /><br />###  An interaction gallery? What?<br /><br />We all know what text on a screen looks like. We all know what an embedded video looks like. But there are so many other ways to allow context to change dynamically to help you learn material better. We sometimes talk about ""responsive design"" to mean webpages that change based on the size of your screen. But the concept goes much further: allowing you to change font size and colors, offline mode, working differently based on language or language direction, whether or not a keyboard is installed, summarising content, and so forth.<br /><br />What if you were reading a paragraph of text about the American Revolution and you could right-click it and say ""Explain this to me like I'm five"" and see the paragraph swap out with something easier to understand? That's an interaction I could put in my gallery.<br /><br />What if instead of visited and unvisited links being a binary thing on a webpage, the page tracked the number of times you clicked on a link and the background got ever-so-slightly darker the more you accessed it? I call that concept ""digital patina"" and it can really help when sifting through long lists of content that you're having to refer back to frequently. I could put that in my gallery.<br /><br />What if at the top of a long whitepaper, you could right-click and say ""summarise this entire white paper for me per section?"" Right now we count on people writing abstracts, but what if you need something a bit more? I could put that concept into my gallery.<br /><br />Do you notice how webpages don't usually track how far down the screen you've read when you return to it later? What if webpages could recognise that you've been here before, then draw your eye to the place where you left off? Or provide a diff between the last time you visited and whatever is new now? Those are two interactions I could put into my gallery.<br /><br />You know that dragger thing they put on some websites to help you compare before/after images, often used to show communities before and after a devastating flood or tornado? That's an interaction that helps with information. I could put that in my gallery.<br /><br />Content management systems, to say nothing of PDFs, ePub books, and traditional books have no way to allow authors anything more complex than text, images, video, or maybe a poll. So we a ceiling on the effectiveness of text. But with the sort of widgets I'm describing, that ceiling could go much higher, and help people much more when absorbing new content.<br /><br />###  An aside about infographics and Tufte<br /><br />I love Edward Tufte as next as the next designer. I saw him speak, I have his books, I appreciate what he teaches, and I think he's brilliant. But oh my gosh, have you ever seen his redesign of the iPhone Stocks app? It's gloriously wrong in almost every way, and it was helpful for me to remind myself that your heroes can be good at some things and not-so-good at others.<br /><br />Throughout this process, I've been chewing on the idea that I want to aim my work at Tufte for modern computing. His iPhone fumbling made it clear he isn't up for the task, and that's fine. More room for me to run!<br /><br />One concept he loves is ""sparklines"" that pack lots of information into a small visual representation on the page. The oldest example he could find was (I believe) Galileo referring to Jupiter with a little drawing to make his point before continuing the text. I think this same spirit is present in what I'm trying to say. Let text sing! But sometimes you need more than text or an image to communicate your point.<br /><br />###  But wait, what about Explorables? <br /><br />Imagine that my final paper is a long webpage dealing with the concept of Explorable Explanations, but the majority of the content is talking about all the components that go into successful interactive communication. It'd sort of be like my paper being about a Ford Mustang, and then most of the paper being about the unique innovations and principles that led to such an iconic car. I think that's what I want to do. Or I might go up another level entirely, and make the paper about Effective Interactive Communication at the top level, then let Explorables be a key source of inspiration but not the main focus.<br /><br />One thing I want to avoid is getting into the silly semantic argument about what makes a game, versus an educational game, versus a simulation, versus interactive text, versus any number of other things. That's not as interesting to me. Instead, I want to mine all of those examples for parts, quantify them, explain them, invent new ones, and put them all in one place. That feels like a good contribution.<br /><br />###  Timeframe<br /><br />I have about 20 days until I officially start. I could focus on other things until July, lord knows I have enough other things to do. But I might be too excited. I might want to get started right away. You can't bottle inspiration. You can only use it when it visits you, and it's here now.",2023-06-10 04:37:23,üéì,b950-8c7f
56,How We Improved Our Focus Mode,https://medium.com/replay-io/how-we-improved-our-focus-mode-db5888f77b1a?source=rss-15b289981db3------2,"<h4>Iterations are where the great stuff¬†happens</h4><p><a href=""https://replay.io"">Replay.io</a> makes a time-traveling debugger, which is as helpful and awesome as it sounds. A few months ago I wrote up the background thinking for a feature we call ‚ÄúFocus Mode‚Äù that lets you, well, <strong>focus</strong> on a certain point in a recording. (It‚Äôs pretty accurately named) You should read¬†it!</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/replay-io/how-we-designed-our-focus-mode-595711802998"">How We Designed Our Focus Mode</a></p><p>We‚Äôve improved the feature in some small yet impactful ways, so I‚Äôd like to share the differences with you today. First up: a new¬†icon!</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fAH_DcxlkGNumMRSCitLJw.png"" /></figure><p>The old icon was fine in the short term, but we quickly realised it looked like a ‚Äúfull screen‚Äù icon, which wasn‚Äôt ideal. So we used a better icon in this iteration, but the more significant improvement is that we‚Äôre using a new capsule-style design that allows us to messaging loading state more¬†clearly.</p><p>Next up, better defaults for the region. Notice how we used to show the entire length of the window, and now we‚Äôre just showing a small area around the current playhead. This is a small detail with big impact. I love this change because it means you can pop into this mode and get a precision selection in less than a¬†second.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vIWOIIWntYmfVQLpvpqxjQ.png"" /></figure><p>And the speed of the feature really lights up when you add the ability to drag it on the timeline, as shown¬†here.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8zz7EFfJQhGSK433uOImxQ.png"" /></figure><p>Before this change, you‚Äôd have to navigate to the right gripper, click and drag, then unclick, seek over to the left gripper, click and drag it, and unclick. If that sounds like a lot of steps, it‚Äôs because it was a lot of steps! Now it works the way you‚Äôd expect from a well-designed app: you can just click and drag it wherever you want it to be.¬†Lovely!</p><h4>Other details</h4><p>There are lots of other great details that went into making this feature sing. There‚Äôs a keyboard shortcut to trigger it (shift-F), it can be saved or canceled from the keyboard (enter and escape, respectively), we have a custom conformation dialog that doesn‚Äôt take so much space, the video is doing some clever things while dragging.</p><p>There are a bunch of items like that, but most of them aren‚Äôt noticeable at first. As we said last time, our design goal is ‚Äúof course it works like that.‚Äù This release gets us one step closer to that ideal. We‚Äôd love to hear what you think about this change, feel free to say hi <a href=""https://replay.io/discord/"">on our¬†Discord</a>!</p><img src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=db5888f77b1a"" width=""1"" height=""1"" alt=""""><hr><p><a href=""https://medium.com/replay-io/how-we-improved-our-focus-mode-db5888f77b1a"">How We Improved Our Focus Mode</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://medium.com/replay-io"">Replay</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",2022-06-03 05:29:09,üìù,7600-dbb3
62,What a Month,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/what-a-month/,"<p>My last brain dump was early February, and now it&#x2019;s the end. There are some things on my mind as we head into March. Things that changed, things that didn&#x2019;t, surprises and shrugs.</p><p><strong>NANA is out, AKIRA is faltering</strong></p><p>I enjoyed NANA for a few weeks, but reached a point where it wasn&#x2019;t doing anything for me anymore. The more I explore, the more I realise I&#x2019;m not particularly interested in story for story&#x2019;s sake. Some rare novels can inspire me like a magic trick, where I see and respect how the author is setting things up for a satisfying conclusion. But in most cases, I&#x2019;m not immersed enough to care. And when it comes to volume after volume of a manga, it&#x2019;s even more clear that there&#x2019;s no real direction. To me it can feel like the end of LOST, where they&#x2019;re just filling time. I don&#x2019;t read for a vibe, I read to reach a clear goal.</p><p>I haven&#x2019;t read AKIRA in a few weeks, but I am encouraged by the idea that the story has a clear beginning, middle, and end. It doesn&#x2019;t feel like much like filler content, which is a good sign. But, shrug, what I really love are memoirs.</p><p><strong>Prince Harry&#x2019;s memoir</strong></p><p>I am not a royal watcher, and I am annoyed by the UK tabloid media. That&#x2019;s where I stand on the Prince Harry story, so as I read his life story I don&#x2019;t have a ton of bias other than being inclined to agree that celebrity culture is toxic. I was surprised by how well the book is written, and found that it was ghostwritten by a highly respected author. Makes sense! It&#x2019;s a good book.</p><p><strong>Moving the Playstation</strong></p><p>It shouldn&#x2019;t really matter if I move my Playstation from one room to another, right? And yet I know it does, and I&#x2019;m excited to see what sorts of changes it brings to my daily routine when I make the switch this morning. I&#x2019;ll be moving it into the main family room, which means more games played as a family. Not typically two player, but rather one person playing an epic one player game while others watch.</p><p><strong>The kids started school</strong></p><p>It&#x2019;s a big school year for all of my kids, and so far things seem to be going well. It&#x2019;s awesome seeing each of them take on more responsibility and figure out how to balance everything. Watching kids grow up is fun.</p><p><strong>Still no luck with databases</strong></p><p>Maybe eventually I&#x2019;ll break through on this front, but it hasn&#x2019;t happened so far. I know once I can unlock this one step, I&#x2019;ll be able to build much more exciting stuff, so I&#x2019;m eager to finally figure it out.</p><p><strong>AI, AI, AI</strong></p><p>I went to the afterparty for a conference I didn&#x2019;t attend, and ran into an old friend. &#x201C;So what&#x2019;s new? What&#x2019;s exciting?&#x201D; I looked back sheepishly and didn&#x2019;t say anything. &#x201C;Oh, so AI right?&#x201D; Right. It&#x2019;s like when the web first exploded in popularity. Why would anyone talk about anything else?</p><p>I&#x2019;ve basically given up on trying to write about AI, because things are changing so quickly from day to day that it feels like a waste of time. But I did get to sit down with my mom and say &#x201C;this is the sort of conversation that you will remember for the rest of your life. I mean it.&#x201D; And after I showed her chatGPT we both agreed that, if anything, I was underselling it.</p><p><strong>A personal style in Midjourney</strong></p><p>I&#x2019;ve been posting lots of images to my Firehose site, and getting better at prompt engineering. I think that term sounded a little awkward and precious at first, but it doesn&#x2019;t anymore. Not to me, anyway. The future will be about prompt engineering. Whether you do it yourself as a consumer or it&#x2019;s all happening behind the scenes, prompt engineering is now a verb, alongside other permanent fixtures like Google stalking or doom-scrolling.</p><p><strong>I keep seeing amazing companies</strong></p><p>There are some really amazing companies out there right now, and they&#x2019;re hiring. Yes, a lot of tech people lost their jobs. Yes, big companies are in hiring freezes. But there are plenty of companies that are flush with cash, enough for a few years of runway, and they&#x2019;re looking for new people. It&#x2019;s fascinating seeing millions of big company tech workers let go while the startup space feels as healthy as ever.</p><p>That&#x2019;s not quite true, of course. Someone who actually studies this stuff could point out that valuations used to be like 30x and now they&#x2019;re 10x, and something something market cap billions blah blah blah. But from where I sit, startups don&#x2019;t seem to be in a bad place. Relative to three years ago, sure. But in absolute terms, are startups a bad place to be? Absolutely not.</p><p><strong>I want to teach!</strong></p><p>I&#x2019;ve always known I&#x2019;ve wanted to teach. I am working on making that happen, but maybe not in as direct a way as I usually tackle my plans. It&#x2019;s less A to B and more &#x2026; I should have coffee with a lot of As and maybe eventually I&#x2019;ll get to step X. Networking is indirect, which is why nerds struggle to figure it out, yet it&#x2019;s an absolute requirement.</p><p><strong>Dice versus intuition</strong></p><p>I don&#x2019;t like when games are too spreadsheet-oriented. I don&#x2019;t want to know that a sword has 53 attack and +3 defense when paired with shield. It takes all the magic out of it. I want a game where you pick up a sword and &#x2026; just like real life, you don&#x2019;t know its raw stats. Just like real life, you can have a hunch. Just like real life, you can talk to experts, but just like real life even experts could disagree. I like the idea that you have to discover, not just lazily be shown all the math.</p><p>And that&#x2019;s how networking works. If you go on five coffee chats, <em>something</em> will happen. Who knows what? Or in what timeline? You just have to trust the process, even if you don&#x2019;t see a &#x201C;+2 charmed&#x201D; symbol lights up over someone&#x2019;s head when you say the &#x201C;right&#x201D; answer. Life is confusing and vague. Dive in!</p><p><strong>Postscript</strong></p><p>I jotted this down while I waited for my oatmeal to cool down. My app tells me I wrote a little over 1000 words. That&#x2019;s a lot of words! Which is another reminder: I love to write, and it comes easily to me. Anything I do in my future can, and should, have a strong writing tie-in. Some people couldn&#x2019;t reliably write a thousand words if their life depended on it! I&#x2019;m the reverse, my life depends on communicating through words. I should find ways to amplify that. Like teaching. Which will start with coffee chats. I have three next week.</p>",2023-02-25 20:45:48,üí¨,537b-e9d8

232,"Writer‚Äôs Workshop, part #2",https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/writers-workshop-part-2/,"<p>Last time I sketched out a world where people couldn&#x2019;t go further than one mile from their birthplace. I didn&#x2019;t actually write a story, though. I just talked about all the different things I&#x2019;d need to figure out to make the world work. Ancient times or modern life? Has it always been like this, or did it change all at once? When you leave a mile from your home, do you die or just feel bad? And so forth. It was a lot of fun to think through, although I did realise that I probably need to know more about history to really do a good job with a book like this.</p><p>But that doesn&#x2019;t have to stop me from sketching something out! So in this edition I&#x2019;m going to do as high-level a concept a sketch as I can without getting myself into too much trouble. Here we go. Deep breaths. I can do this. Ok.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p><strong>Chapter 1: Blissful Boundaries</strong></p><p>In an ancient village ensconced within a verdant valley, a young boy&apos;s life unfolds like any other child&apos;s would. He plays, he learns, he grows. But the world he inhabits is a microcosm, limited by mysterious rules and an invisible boundary. His community, bound together by shared space and shared resources, thrives despite its limitations. Through their myths and folklore, they have found ways to explain and accept their circumscribed existence. Distrustful of the unknown, they rely on rituals, rules, and an intense sense of community to navigate their world. Yet, despite the constraints, the boy is content, finding joy in the simplicity of his existence.</p><p><strong>Chapter 2: Uninvited Disruption</strong></p><p>One fateful day, the rhythm of village life is disrupted by the arrival of a stranger. In a world where everyone is familiar, the sight of an unknown face triggers a whirlwind of fear, curiosity, and confusion. The stranger, visibly ill and spouting unintelligible words, is a human paradox &#x2013; a threat and a mystery, an outsider who has somehow crossed the uncrossable line. Despite their fear, the villagers tend to him, their compassion overpowering their wariness. But the man&apos;s life slips away, leaving behind a barrage of questions. From where did he journey? Why did he come here? And most importantly, how did he manage to defy the unseen boundary that keeps them all in check?</p><p><strong>Chapter 3: The Stranger&apos;s Legacy</strong></p><p>In the wake of the stranger&apos;s mysterious appearance and subsequent death, the village is engulfed in heated discussion. The once cohesive community finds itself divided, torn between curiosity about the outside world and fear of the unknown. The boy, previously sheltered from such dilemmas, finds himself embroiled in the discourse, serving as an observer, and a participant. His understanding of his world, once simplistic and accepting, is beginning to evolve. Parallels are drawn between the stranger&apos;s story and the legends they were raised on, leading some to argue that this incident is a warning from the gods.</p><p><strong>Chapter 4: The March Beyond</strong></p><p>Fueled by curiosity and a newfound restlessness, the village sends out carefully selected patrols to explore the nearby territories. Despite the warnings from the village&apos;s religious members who view this action as a direct defiance of the gods, the villagers cannot deny their shared sense of intrigue and desire for discovery. As the patrols venture beyond their familiar perimeters, they find themselves battling not only their physical limitations but also the ingrained fear that they are stepping into forbidden territory.</p><p><strong>Chapter 5: Time, the Great Healer, and Provoker</strong></p><p>Time passes, and the patrols return with no news of other settlements, but the village has been irrevocably changed. There&apos;s a shift in the way the villagers perceive their world - a sense of unease has replaced their previous complacency. The boy, now a young man, is particularly affected. The memory of the stranger&apos;s arrival and his subsequent demise, coupled with the fruitless patrols, instills in him a relentless curiosity and a longing to journey beyond the village boundaries. The thought of breaking the age-old tradition is both daunting and thrilling, setting the stage for the next chapter of his life.</p><p><strong>Chapter 6: Pioneers of the In-Between</strong></p><p>The village morphs with time, but the strange echo of the outsider&apos;s visit never truly fades. Seeking expansion, some daring villagers experiment with birthing their children on the outskirts of their boundary, in an area now ominously dubbed &quot;The In-Between.&quot; This defiant act accelerates the growth of their civilization, but at the cost of breaking a long-standing taboo. The village is no longer a single entity; now, each individual exists within their own personal boundary. They devise primitive tools and markers to help them navigate, although their own bodies and emotions never fail to remind them when they&apos;ve strayed too far.</p><p><strong>Chapter 7: Yearning Beyond the Border</strong></p><p>The boy, now a young man, is consumed with the desire to explore, fuelled by the memory of the mysterious stranger. While the village&apos;s exploratory missions have expanded their hunting grounds and diversified their food sources, they have yet to encounter other civilizations. The young man finds his dreams too expansive for the confines of his village, he wants to connect with the larger world.</p><p><strong>Chapter 8: Love in the Boundaries</strong></p><p>Love blossoms within the confines of the village, as the boy finds his heart tied to a childhood friend. She is deeply religious, her views contrasting with his desire for exploration. Yet, through countless conversations and shared moments, their bond deepens. They marry, and soon she is expecting a child. Despite her spiritual leanings, she agrees to birth their child at the edge of their boundary, becoming one of the controversial Boundaryfolk, much to the disdain of their traditional community.</p><p><strong>Chapter 9: The Outcasts</strong></p><p>The birth of their son solidifies the family&apos;s status as outcasts within the village. The harsh judgment of their former community stings, but they find solace among their fellow Boundaryfolk. The newly formed group, each bearing the mark of rebellion, accepts them readily, providing them with the support and community they need.</p><p><strong>Chapter 10: Legacy of Curiosity</strong></p><p>Despite the limitations of his boundary, the father embarks on a quest to understand the mysterious rules of their existence through primitive science. He is met with disapproval, as his methods clash with the village&apos;s religious beliefs, but his curiosity remains undeterred. He teaches his son to approach their world with a similar sense of inquiry, fostering a scientific mindset within the boy that further distances him from the more traditional villagers.</p><p><strong>Chapter 11: The Great Divide</strong></p><p>The weight of societal pressure, coupled with lingering personal doubts, eventually drives a wedge between the parents. The mother, unable to endure the isolation and criticism, decides to leave the Boundaryfolk, resulting in a bitter divorce. The boy, though affected by the split, finds solace in the stronger bond that develops with his father. Yet, a kernel of doubt and uncertainty continues to linger within him.</p><p><strong>Chapter 12: Loss and Reconnection</strong></p><p>In a tragic twist of fate, the father, who ventured out on a daring mission to unravel the mysteries of their world, loses his life in the pursuit of knowledge. The boy, now bereft of his father&apos;s presence, is drawn back towards his mother, whose life is steeped in the traditions of the village. The community&apos;s Traditionalists hold sway over certain parts of the village, and it is here that the mother has found solace. Though their relationship is fractured, the boy and his mother strive to build a fragile bridge of understanding.</p><p><strong>Chapter 13: Inheritance of Contradictions</strong></p><p>Left with the legacy of his father&apos;s scientific pursuits and his mother&apos;s steadfast traditionalism, the boy finds himself at a crossroads. He values the teachings of both parents, appreciating the questioning spirit his father instilled in him, as well as the comfort and familiarity of his mother&apos;s traditions. But he soon finds himself forced to pick a side. He decides to align himself with his mother and her family, drawn by the warmth and familiarity. Yet, beneath the surface, the spark of curiosity his father kindled continues to flicker.</p><p><strong>Chapter 14: Unexpected Visitors</strong></p><p>Unexpectedly, a party of five strangers arrives at the edge of the village, a territory known to be the Boundaryfolk&apos;s domain. The boy, now a part of the Traditionalists, watches from a distance, his curiosity piqued. In a surprising turn of events, the Boundaryfolk, recognizing the boy&apos;s unique understanding of both worlds, seek his help to facilitate communication with the outsiders. The strangers come bearing items for trade, offering an opportunity for exchange and discovery. The boy is presented with a choice, one that could have far-reaching implications for him and his divided community.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>I&#x2019;ll stop there. This is fun! Pretty thrilled with the story so far, gotta say.</p>",2023-05-26 09:39:23,üí¨,d5f1-25ff
256,The QWERTY Monoblock Lesson,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/the-qwerty-monoblock-lesson/,"<p>I was a designer on Windows Phone about a decade ago, and one of my R&amp;D explorations was called QWERTY Monoblock. It was a Windows Phone that also had a standard Blackberry-style hardware keyboard. At this point, the iPhone had already passed its fifth birthday, so adding a keyboard was already seen as a retro move. As my team worked on the concepts, it became clear that we were working with flawed premise, even for people who like hardware keyboards.</p><p>My manager and good friend tried motivating me with my love of Steve Jobs by saying &#x201C;What would Steve Jobs do with this creative brief?&#x201D; and my dam broke. I remember angrily spitting out &#x201C;He&#x2019;d call this out for the bullshit that it is. He&#x2019;d cancel it. There&#x2019;s nothing redeemable about this concept. It&#x2019;s a dead end. It&#x2019;s dumb.&#x201D; It wasn&#x2019;t a very professional thing to say, and I immediately felt bad. He gave me a look. But let&#x2019;s not overlook that I was also right. It was in fact a dumb premise, and the higher-ups knew it. The R&amp;D on the product was canceled soon afterwards and these days it&#x2019;s hard to find a hardware keyboard on a smartphone.</p><hr><p>Imagine being a designer of a new augmented reality headset (I prefer the word &#x201C;helmet&#x201D;) at any company today, now that Apple has tipped their hand. Meta is the biggest, but there are also plenty of people at Microsoft, Google, Valve, etc who are building in this space. Let&#x2019;s say your manager comes into your office and explains the mission statement for your team&#x2019;s next product: &#x201C;We&#x2019;re going to take inspiration from Apple Vision Pro, but we&#x2019;re going to make it much, much cheaper.&#x201D; Solid premise, one that has a chance of working. If it were me, I&#x2019;d only have one question, and that one question would only have one right answer:</p><p>&#x201C;Will we show eyes on the outside of the device the way Apple does?&#x201D;</p><p>The answer will be no, which is not the right answer. You&#x2019;ll be told it&#x2019;s too hard, too expensive, makes the device too heavy, take too much battery, and besides, developing it will take too long, and your team needs to get something into the market within a year, or even six months. If you point out that you can&#x2019;t compete against Apple Vision Pro without imitating their breakthrough &#x201C;ski goggles&#x201D; feature, you&#x2019;ll be told you&#x2019;re drinking the Apple Kool-aid. So you&#x2019;ll do your best to make the best Apple Vision Pro competitor without their key differentiator. It will eventually launch, late (naturally), and it will fail.</p><p>Headsets that don&#x2019;t show your eyes are going to disappear from the market as decisively as phones with hardware keyboards. Count on it.</p>",2023-06-10 21:29:37,üí¨,397a-f763
314,"The Stuff of Life, September 2023 edition",https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/the-stuff-of-life-september-2023-edition/,"<p>Sometimes you&#x2019;re sitting in a coffee shop, watching people walk by through the windows, and you think to yourself, &#x201C;This is nice.&#x201D; My friends I like to call these moments &#x201C;the stuff of life,&#x201D; which is a bit like that John Lennon lyric about how life is what happens when you&#x2019;re making other plans. The big moments like wedding and new jobs matter, but it&#x2019;s all the day-to-day smaller things that end up mattering much, much more. They&#x2019;re built through routine rather than one-off gestures or moments. If your life is a house, the four walls are the big stuff like your friends, your job, and where you sleep. But ok, what are you going to put inside your house, metaphorically speaking? Here are some of &#x201C;stuff of life&#x201D; things that I&#x2019;m experiencing lately.</p><p><strong>Groove</strong></p><p>At work, I had a really focused week, to the point of feeling &#x201C;in the zone.&#x201D; I&#x2019;ve been tracking my time pretty closely, and rather than having 15 different tasks pinging at me all day, I got to spend most of the week on one task. Something I&#x2019;m particularly good at, and is particularly important for the company. I&#x2019;ve been putting my head up and realising that two hours have evaporated. Then I&#x2019;ll take a little break, focus in again, and boop, three more hours gone. It&#x2019;s felt good, but sometimes a bit unsettling as well. Grooves are good because they help you go fast. But depending how deep you go, the sunlight might not reach you.</p><p><strong>Spring socialising</strong></p><p>As the northern hemisphere plunges into autumn, things are starting to heat up here in the southern hemisphere. And completely coincidentally, my social calendar this weekend is busier than it&#x2019;s been in ages. Last night, I hung out with a friend I haven&#x2019;t seen in over a year. This afternoon I&#x2019;ll be going to another friend&#x2019;s birthday party. This evening I&#x2019;m going to a costume showcase at my wife&#x2019;s old school, where she&#x2019;ll reconnect with some old friends.</p><p>Making friends is hard, and maintaining friendships as you get older is harder still. But I&#x2019;ve been working at it over the years, and my efforts are slowly bearing fruit. It feels good, and I have high hopes for the trajectory here.</p><p><strong>Japan</strong></p><p>A friend moved to Japan and I&#x2019;ve been eagerly following along. It&#x2019;s very exciting to see someone make a big leap and try new things, and seeing updates of Japanese stuff of life has been a big highlight.</p><p><strong>Space</strong></p><p>There&#x2019;s this new video game called Starfield. If you know about No Man&#x2019;s Sky, Fallout, or Skyrim, this game will feel familiar. Some have described it as No Man&#x2019;s Sky as an RPG or Skyrim in space. This might be the first time I&#x2019;ve really lost myself in a character, other than playing D&amp;D. I like thinking about the mechanics of the game, and how the designers and creators made something feel so immersive to me. I infamously have trouble feeling truly immersed in games because I get bored and would rather go create something.</p><p>In this game, they&#x2019;ve offered me enough things to create, so I&#x2019;m more likely to stick around. I designed a spaceship from scratch, which took a long time and was very enjoyable. I&#x2019;m starting to build a network of outposts that can communicate with each other. So maybe outpost #1 can mine materials x and y, then outpost #2 can mine materials a and b, then I can send all those materialist to one location to craft items and sell them for a profit. I love thinking about ops and process, and this scratches that itch.</p><p>The writing for the game is good, better than I&#x2019;m used to. I&#x2019;m finding myself committed to learning more about the plot, whereas I usually ignore the plot outright and go exploring. Sometimes I progress the story, sometimes I decide to pick a random planet to investigate. It all feels good. I&#x2019;ve been enjoying my journey, and it&#x2019;s been fun seeing my character come to life through all the little decisions I make day to day. Because it&#x2019;s not about the character&#x2019;s job, or the spaceship. It&#x2019;s about all the little things in between.</p>",2023-09-15 21:12:32,üí¨,5079-5616

348,"December 6, 2023",https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/december-6-2023/,"<p><strong>One thing took from GTD</strong></p><p>The &#x201C;GTD&#x201D; craze, which stood for Getting Things Done, seemed half helpful and half silly. The helpful part was helping people feel more productive, a noble pursuit. The silly part was everything else. One thing I learned from GTD was the benefit of a &#x201C;brain dump&#x201D; to get started with tasks. A todo list shouldn&#x2019;t start with the thing you want to do first. It should be a clearing of the decks.</p><p><strong>One thing I took from Medium&#x2019;s office</strong></p><p>I visited the Medium offices once. I had written things online, someone at Medium liked them, and he invited me to his office. At the time, &#x201C;holocracy&#x201D; was a big topic of discussion as an alternate way to run teams, so I asked my host what he thought of it. He said if he started a company from scratch, he wouldn&#x2019;t take much from holocracy, but he would take its approach to running meetings.</p><p><strong>One thing I took from a meeting today</strong></p><p>We&#x2019;re working on a product, and that product has different features. I&#x2019;m building an onboarding experience for new users. A coworker is building the core of the product itself. Today we ran a meeting about launching the overall product, and at one point I realised there was no plan at that level. Only for different features within the larger product, not a larger roadmap. I volunteered to write up that plan.</p><p><strong>The &#x201C;culture stack&#x201D;</strong></p><p>In 2019, I was planning on starting a company with my friend. We spent some time talking about the best way to start a thing from scratch, and I started using the phrase &#x201C;culture stack&#x201D; to refer to the blend of tools, processes, expectations, and overall culture that drives a business. It was fun to think about, and I realised after writing some memos what strong ideas I have on the subject.</p><p><strong>The design leader who I impressed and also didn&#x2019;t impress</strong></p><p>I love talking about ops. I presented a talk once called Design Ops Inspiration Gallery, where I showed off 10 cultural features I benefited from in previous companies. The talk went great. A few years later, a recruiter was helping me find a job. She ran my name by a design leader, who looked at my bare bones website and said, paraphrased, &#x201C;there is no way the impressive man I saw on stage owns this horrible website.&#x201D; I improved my website.</p><p><strong>Concussions</strong></p><p>I got a concussion one week ago today, and this was the first day I didn&#x2019;t go the entire day with a lingering headache. I am slowly recovering, but I am mourning some lost freedom. I think I need to play a less competitive level of futsol, for the sake of my brain. This isn&#x2019;t my first concussion this year.</p><p><strong>Busy and blocked</strong></p><p>I&#x2019;m good at creating a bunch of content. I don&#x2019;t often let writer&#x2019;s block get the best of me. I know, perhaps more than anyone in my life, how to drive forward creatively even when you don&#x2019;t feel like it. And yet! I have a thesis to write and the sheer size of it is making it hard for me to enjoy other tasks. The only way through is to keep chipping at it, but I like to give myself small wins on the side. Writing this is a small win on the side.</p>",2023-12-05 06:02:22,üí¨,5cd4-95a2

373,Intense email #2,https://academia.lot23.com/post/43,"I was asked if I had opinions about <a href=""https://www.bryanlehrer.com/entries/new-internet/"">https://www.bryanlehrer.com/entries/new-internet/</a> and I wrote this:<br /><br />Walter,<br /><br />You asked me about this essay and I didn‚Äôt respond!<br /><br />I find it adorable, relatable, and I could have copy and pasted the same feelings from any decade. Young person is idealistic. Meets friends and tries crazy things. The memories are amazing but the progress is slow or non existent. Now a yearning for those simpler times.<br /><br />I think these articles are a) extremely important to write as part of the growing process b) all pretty much the same. I‚Äôve heard the ‚Äúold web was better‚Äù argument more times than ‚Äúrock is dead‚Äù or ‚ÄúSNL‚Äôs quality peaked when I was a teenager and now everything is worse.‚Äù It‚Äôs all a matter of perspective. Being young and idealistic is awesome, being old and (more) content with the status quo is, we all agree, something to be avoided. So these are the essays people write as they move from idealist to realist.<br /><br />One thing that continually puzzles me about these proto-‚Äúget off my lawn‚Äù discussions about BIG TECH and INTERMEDIARIES and THE WEB WE LOST and on and on is ‚Ä¶ human centred design. Talking about what people want, rather than what idealists *believe* they should want. Why doesn‚Äôt that come up more often?<br /><br />For example: people hate IRC, so we got Slack. People hate randomly clicking around and trying to StumbleUpon something good, so we get algorithmic TikTok timeline that are really good at offering content you will enjoy. People hate navigating crusty old PHP-run forums so we get Facebook Groups. People don‚Äôt like thrash metal in large numbers, so we get Taylor Swift, who people do love in large numbers. I consider all of this very good, because we‚Äôre giving the widest number of people the best experience we possibly can, based on what they are asking for. <br /><br />And the funny bit is that the strange fringe stuff has never been more vibrant! In raw numbers, we now have more strange projects, not fewer, than we have ever had before. It‚Äôs not like the rise of Instagram reduced the number of strange anarchist collective creative groups; it actually increased them! Same with Starbucks: the number of indie coffee houses *went up* significantly in the shadow of Starbucks, so I find the critique of ‚Äúbig business killed small business‚Äù to be an overly simplistic and often flatly untrue position to take.<br /><br />At the end of the day, more people *prefer* Starbucks, Taylor Swift, Instagram, and a tightly controlled App Store than a lot of people understand. Obscure coffee houses, thrash metal, a blockchain-driven media repository, and sideloading Steam games rife with bugs, security holes, and poor UX definitely have their place ‚Ä¶ in the minority. They‚Äôre allowed to exist, and they do. But if they were truly superior ideas for most people, they‚Äôd have more people wanting them.<br /><br />And as a product designer, I‚Äôm always surprised how little those points are discussed. It‚Äôs all utopian visions of a nerd internet, without realising that most people don‚Äôt actually want the things the utopians are selling.",2024-01-27 22:26:55,üéì,7dd0-544f

160,It feels good,https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=52361,"
<p>Over the last few weeks, I've been spotting some bugs in my apps. Well, that's not quite right. I spotted them right away, but I just now got annoyed enough to go fix them. I set up on the couch, tuned in to the Seattle Sounders game, and dove in to the work. Then, after a time, ... everything was fixed. Like magic.</p>
<p>Soon I'll barely remember how I used to do things, like imagining life without a smartphone, the internet, or motorised vehicles. I'll be vaguely aware of a time when I'd spend a few hours trying to get code working, only to go to bed frustrated and try again in the morning, then get foiled again, then eventually give up. I'll assume there was a time where a lot of things felt beyond my ability to grasp it, and I'll sympathise with that poor old version of myself.</p>
<p>But that's not who I am now.</p>
<p>Today, I pasted my broken code into an AI and explained how I wanted to fix it. It suggested some better approaches, and I went back and forth a bit to custom-fit it to my needs. When I needed additional context, I asked for it, and it taught me line by line what I needed to do, and why. Once I understood (which is not a prerequisite), I slapped the code into my editor and it worked the first time. Because of course it did. This is just how things work now.</p>
<p>I followed this process this for about 4 or 5 different bugs. They're all fixed now. No biggie.</p>
<p>This is the future I was promised.</p>

223,Analysing a throwaway line,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/analysing-a-throwaway-line/,"<p>I spend a lot of time thinking about stagecraft and delivery. I&#x2019;m the sort of person who will bring a sketchbook to a standup comedy show to analyse each joke. I want to figure out what worked, what didn&#x2019;t, and why. I want to think through the cadence and the sequencing. I love seeing the details. I love the craft of communication. So I&#x2019;m going to aim that at my own writing.</p><p>This line:</p><blockquote>Anything other than &#x2014; this is where I should come up with some great turn of phrase describing exactly how tacky and bad the signs are, but you know what, fuck you because I don&#x2019;t care &#x2014; anything other than that. I just wanted to wash the words away somehow. The whole thing felt rude to me.</blockquote><p>Sometimes analysis makes things seem more important than they really are, so let me start by saying I don&#x2019;t consider this great writing. Sometimes we fall short, so the safest excuse is to pretend you <em>meant</em> to fall short. That&#x2019;s not what happened here. It was both not great writing but also pretty well-considered. I didn&#x2019;t mean for it to be bad, per se, but I was trying for something. So let me explain what I was shooting for, even if it&#x2019;s not high art.</p><p><a href=""https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/dooce/"">The post</a> was about how the famous blogger Dooce committed suicide, but I used that as a launching-off point to make a broader point about mental health and how easy it is for us to feel overwhelmed. And my point wasn&#x2019;t a secret. I showed my sleeves in the first paragraph, as plainly as I could:</p><blockquote>[&#x2026;/] I don&#x2019;t want to say much about Heather. I want to say this other thing instead, I guess.</blockquote><p><br>Then I veered over to a story about how billboards are tacky, and being barraged by data at all times isn&#x2019;t good for us. Then I landed the plane by saying it&#x2019;s not just billboards, overload is everywhere, even from our own friends.</p><blockquote>I don&#x2019;t care. Tell it to someone else. Someone else who has space to hear it. Count me out. Because I need less, please. So did Heather. And so do you.</blockquote><p>So that&#x2019;s the arc I was going for, and right in the middle of all of it, I said the &#x201C;fuck you because I don&#x2019;t care&#x201D; line. I thought about how to write that line for a long time. Was it too rude? Was there another way to express my feelings that would work better? More clear, less confronting, more mature, less coarse? I couldn&#x2019;t come up with anything, so I published. Here it is again, for reference:</p><blockquote>Anything other than &#x2014; this is where I should come up with some great turn of phrase describing exactly how tacky and bad the [billboards] are, but you know what, fuck you because I don&#x2019;t care &#x2014; anything other than that. I just wanted to wash the words away somehow. The whole thing felt rude to me.</blockquote><p>The thing is, I <em>meant</em> the fuck you. You. Reading this. You&#x2019;re my friend, or my family, or someone who likes my writing, or something. How rude for me to say fuck you! Surely I meant it as a throwaway line. Surely it wasn&#x2019;t aimed at anyone, and I was just using the f word to explain the power of my grief? Well, yes and no. It was very intentional.</p><p>This was me crying uncle, and as much as I love &#x201C;you&#x201D;, whoever you are, also fuck you. Because you&#x2019;re people, and I&#x2019;m having trouble with people. Whether overwhelming billboards or social expectations or the onslaught of &#x201C;lol we&#x2019;re doomed&#x2019; cynicism I have to fight through every day, it&#x2019;s all too much.</p><p>So what about the run-on sentence? Again, I&#x2019;m not claiming this is great writing that deserves a whole analysis, but let&#x2019;s do it anyway.</p><ol><li>Anything other than &#x2014;</li><li>this is where I should come up with some great turn of phrase describing exactly how tacky and bad the [billboards] are, but you know what, fuck you because I don&#x2019;t care</li><li>&#x2014; anything other than that.</li><li>I just wanted to wash the words away somehow.</li><li>The whole thing felt rude to me.</li></ol><p>I edited that pile of words for a while and still ended up with this hot mess. It wasn&#x2019;t a first or second draft, if you can believe it. By the time I was done, I really liked how poorly the aside (#2) is book-ended by items #1 and #3. Parentheticals and asides are supposed to work even when you remove them, but in this case #3 restates #1, and I liked that grammatical stutter.</p><p>&#x201C;Anything other than [&#x2026;] anything other than that.&#x201D;</p><p>That&#x2019;s garbage, and I wanted garbage. I wanted the aside to be disorienting and make you feel like walking on something rickety just about to give out. I wanted to not stick the landing. I liked the idea that I&#x2019;m writing a stream-of-consciousness journal-style outpouring of emotion (#1), then I fall down the stairs into a self-pitying, out-of-nowhere burst of anger, then don&#x2019;t even get back on track correctly.</p><ul><li>I want to say</li><li>And speaking of which, fuck you</li><li>So anyway I wanted to say</li></ul><p>It&#x2019;s like DJ Shadow <a href=""https://youtu.be/HORLJvUMs08?t=160&amp;ref=a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io"">completely failing to keep to a pleasing beat</a> and accidentally turning it into one of the most iconic moments in all of hip-hop. Not in terms of <em>quality</em> but at least in terms of intention. Dooce fucking killed herself. You&#x2019;re not going to get sad orchestral strings from me. You&#x2019;re not going to get inspirational EDM with a caption saying if you&#x2019;re experiencing thoughts of self-harm or suicide, please call this number. No, you&#x2019;re getting discordant noise. That&#x2019;s what I have to offer at this point. I know someone who talks about being overwhelmed feeling like a &#x201C;swarm of bees.&#x201D; Welcome to my swarm of bees. They sting. Don&#x2019;t say I didn&#x2019;t warn you. Yes, you. Fuck you. And I&#x2019;m sorry.</p><p>But then #4 and #5 act as a palette cleanser, a deserved apology, and the start of my explanation.</p><ol><li>I just wanted to wash the words away somehow.</li><li>The whole thing felt rude to me.</li></ol><p>There are three paragraphs after that. I explain what I&#x2019;m struggling with, I purposely stretch everything into run-on sentences, I start capitalising concepts to make them feel weightier, but I am doing it with sarcasm and anger. I&#x2019;m picking a fight. I&#x2019;m explaining how useless it all feels, and how I can&#x2019;t handle it.</p><blockquote>You probably want some examples. I don&#x2019;t want to share examples. But in general terms, everyone has Great Taste and is a Perfect Driver and is Really Good At Spotting Bullshit and Is Never Wrong and Knows Who the Enemy Is and Wants To Tell Me About It and I&#x2019;m done. I don&#x2019;t care.</blockquote><p>So that&#x2019;s why I wrote it like that. I edited and re-edited for a while. I wondered if there was any other way, and I couldn&#x2019;t find one. This is what I wanted to say, and I said it the best I could.</p>",2023-05-20 00:09:47,üí¨,ff42-9b7f
237,"Friday Night Update: June 2, 2023",https://academia.lot23.com/post/22,"There's a wonderful pub near my house called The Realm. It's in a building that's been around for about 100 years, and whenever I sit in it (only about 4 times so far!) I am reminded how lucky I am to live in this neighbourhood. I often compare it to living in a Richard Scarry book, where a bunch of villagers all work together in a wonderful, functioning society. That's how my neighbourhood feels. It's amazing. Moving to New Zealand has been a blessing, and coming into my village often reminds me all over again.<br /><br />This evening I'm sitting at a little round table with a new kind of beer the bartender thought I might like, with a rugby game on the air, an older couple playing darts to my right, and bunch of tradies playing pool and getting rowdy outside on the patio. The table has a little sign on it advertising the monthly pool tournament that's the first Sunday of the month every month. $100 for first place! There are two signed rugby jerseys in frames on the walls. There's a gaming (aka gambling) section adjoining the side of the bar. There's a bunch of photos of people's families on a corkboard, mostly their rugby teams.<br /><br />And I'm looking at my paperwork to return to the academic world after being gone for about twenty years. I recently read through all the paperwork, but my mission tonight is to really understand the details. Here's what I think is true:<br /><br />* I have two weeks to write a draft research proposal<br />* Then I have two weeks to make it into a final proposal<br />* Then I have between eight and eleven months to actually do the work<br />* The final paper can't be more than 30,000 words<br />* Oh, and I guess I get my own space to work in on campus? That's cool!<br /><br />Another interesting detail is that I have already written a research proposal, though I do want to update it a bit.

244,Get used to disappointment,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/get-used-to-disappointment/,"<p>Apple announced a product. It does basically the same thing as the things that came before it. It&#x2019;s insanely expensive. It doesn&#x2019;t do the things people think it should. It&#x2019;s pretty, sure, but anyone who actually expects to use this thing is going to be disappointed.</p><p>Am I talking about Apple&#x2019;s new Vision Pro headset? Or am I talking about the 1984 Macintosh, the iMac, iBook, iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Music, AirPods, or Apple Watch? I feel like I have written this article 500 times. I hereby retire from writing it yet again, but I will provide some hints.</p><ul><li>Apple has been very clear that they don&#x2019;t want to pioneer brand-new tech, they want to redefine how it can fit into everyone&#x2019;s life. Put another way, they&#x2019;re not first, they&#x2019;re the first to make something &#x201C;for the rest of us.&#x201D;</li><li>Apple starts expensive with the best experience they can figure out, then they iterate and bring the price down.</li><li>They have a very good track record doing this. Not every time, of course. They have failures. But on big platform moves like this, they&#x2019;re undefeated.</li><li>Apple&#x2019;s vertical integration is basically impossible to beat on their terms.</li><li>Those things that look &#x201C;slick&#x201D; or &#x201C;pretty?&#x201D; That&#x2019;s the secret. Seamlessly integrating hardware and software is their moat. It will be impenetrable until iPhones and Macs are seem as vastly inferior to their competition.</li></ul><p>All the data is out there. The strategy and the plan is easy to analyse. If your big conclusion, like many wrong people before you, is that Apple missed the mark and not even if their sheep-like fans can save them this time, you&#x2019;re in good company. For now. And then as the years go on, and Apple becomes the permanent frontrunner in mindshare, product usage, profit margins, and eventually units sold, a new Apple product will appear on the horizon and we&#x2019;ll say it won&#x2019;t be a hit. Not like iPhone and iPod. Not like Vision Pro.</p><p>That&#x2019;s just how it goes.</p>",2023-06-06 00:34:09,üí¨,28cc-628f

I also wrote <a href=""https://medium.com/@jonbell/blue-sky-1-a8fbc449c88?ref=a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io"">a long comic</a> about some interesting issues they&#x2019;ll come across in terms of moderation. Now it&#x2019;s been several years and Bluesky is nearing a public release. I reached out to some Bluesky contacts and jumped on. It&#x2019;s been interesting.</p><p><strong>Consulting stuff</strong></p><p>I&#x2019;ve been introduced to some Bluesky folks and I had a mentoring call where I worked with a designer involved in a different project idea. It reminded me how much I love teaching people design.</p><p><strong>Work, work, work</strong></p><p>I got to dive really deep into data this week, which I love. I&#x2019;ve been in a great loop of learning new things from data, designing a better solution, coding it up, shipping, tracking the results, and repeating. It&#x2019;s been cool.</p><p><strong>Research</strong></p><p>Speaking of research, I&#x2019;ve been starting research into my big Master of Design project this year. I dusted off Obsidian and I think it will be a helpful research helper. More importantly than tools and processes, I just love being stuck into a new research challenge. It&#x2019;s been fun.</p><p><strong>Vault AI</strong></p><p>I recently learned what &#x201C;vector databases&#x201D; are and they still feel like magic to me. Apparently you put a bunch of stuff into them, they break everything into tiny little pieces, and then you can load it back up pretty easily. This works really well paired with chatGPT. So that&#x2019;s where Vault AI comes in.</p><p>Imagine uploading the entire works of Shakespeare, then searching for the word &#x201C;love.&#x201D; In a traditional search, you&#x2019;d get x results, then you&#x2019;d sift through them. With Vault AI (which uses Pinecone, a vector database), you can say &#x201C;what did Shakespeare think about people in love?&#x201D; and it will give you an actual answer based on an analysis of the data.</p><p>This is a really big deal, so naturally I uploaded everything I&#x2019;ve ever written. The results were a bit underwhelming on my own content, but it could be a game-changer for a company&#x2019;s knowledge base.</p><p><strong>My aperture is too wide</strong></p><p>I love learning new things. But I&#x2019;m learning too many new things right now. I need to sleep more and better. I need to have fewer headaches. I need to work less hard. I need to cut everything back to catch my breath a bit more.</p><p>Less input, more output.</p>",2023-04-21 09:44:50,üí¨,8148-02c5

But I flocked with a smirk, because I&#x2019;ve seen this story before. I remember when Medium.com was amazing because it was so simple. I remember when Blogger was amazing because it was so simple. I remember when Ulysses (and 100 other writing apps) were amazing because they were so simple. I also worked at Microsoft, so I know that simple does not automatically equal good.</p><p>I tell a joke a work that goes like this:</p><p>Q: How does great software become bloated?<br>A: One totally reasonable feature request at a time.</p><p>No one laughs. It&#x2019;s not funny ha ha, it&#x2019;s just a painful reminder that version one of anything is simple because it doesn&#x2019;t <em>do</em> anything yet. But by the time you get to version 3, or if you&#x2019;re somehow lucky enough to reach version 10, simplicity is gone. Not because people forgot how to design, but because at that point your software actually <em>does something</em>.</p><p>So when Linear was about 7 seconds old, we were working with a new client that had put a spunky, young, ambitious PM in charge of the project. She declared we&#x2019;d be using Notion. Not Microsoft something something, not Google something something, but Notion. Which absolutely zero people in the room had ever heard of. I smirked and watched. Everyone went along with it because she was very confident in her decision.</p><p>Afterwards, I approached her with my smirk. I felt like we were two fans of an obscure band, and I wanted to do the special handshake with her. I wanted to say I saw her forward-looking approach, and appreciated it.</p><p>Me: Notion, eh? I love Notion.</p><p>Her: Yeah, isn&#x2019;t it great? <br>Me: It is! It&#x2019;ll be cool running this outside of Google or Microsoft software.</p><p>Her: Totally. I think it&#x2019;s going to really help.</p><p>But then I went a little too far.</p><p>Me: Funny thing about bloat: one day we&#x2019;ll be talking about how Notion used to be better and simpler. It happens to all software.</p><p>Her, confused: What?</p><p>Me: Oh sorry, never mind.</p><p>Well, that day is here. Notion is cool. It&#x2019;s also bloated. Welcome to the game.

224,Some background on my cooking journey,https://cooking.lot23.com/post/2,"I don't cook much. I can make a homemade pizza. I can throw spaghetti in a big pot, overcook it, and slap some bottled pasta sauce on it. I can make toad-in-a-hole and grilled cheese really well. I can do a thing I call ""Jon Soup"" which is tomato soup, rice, and chopped sausage. Probably some other things, but you get the point. Bachelor food, low quality, bad for you. (Oh, I made tacos once. And I make sandwiches with deli meats.)<br /><br />So that's where I'm coming from. I can feed my kids, technically, but I don't prepare dinners in the traditional way, where I cut vegetables, slave over a hot oven, and so forth. A week of dinners might look like this:<br /><br />2-3 dinners cooked by Sarah    <br />1 night of tater-tots and chicken nuggets  <br />1 night of takeaways (I forget how we say that word in America. To-gos?)  <br />2-3 nights of leftovers  <br /><br />We've been together for 25 years, and I've never been able to cook much. It doesn't mean we sit around and wait for mom to make something. We're more than happy to throw on some pasta, heat up some leftovers, make a homemade pizza, and so forth. There's no *expectation* that Sarah will cook, and for the last two years while she was in school we foraged and did pretty well through her long hours.<br /><br />But if we're going to eat real food, the sort of meal you wouldn't be embarrassed to mention cooking for your kids, there is definitely an expectation that if anyone's gonna do it, it's gonna be Sarah. And that's not good, obviously.<br /><br />This year, as Mother's Day drew nearer, I told Sarah that as an enlightened husband I know that buying a mom cleaning supplies for Mother's Day is bad. And I think the same goes for cooking breakfast or dinner. In an equal partnership, making ONE MEAL shouldn't be seen as a once-in-a-year treat. So I told her that I was going to make dinner on Sunday, but IT WAS NOT A MOTHER'S DAY PRESENT. JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR.<br /><br />She had a good idea. She asked me to take cooking classes, and make *that* my Mother's Day present. Brilliant! I signed up for some classes, and on Mother's Day, my This-Is-Totally-Not-Your-Mother's-Day-Gift dinner was pulled pork cooked with a slow cooker. She told me how to do each step, and I think I should be able to figure it out myself next time.<br /><br />The meal went well! (I also did veggies and potatoes) This week we've been living off of leftovers, and now the weekend is drawing near. I've decided this Sunday I'm going to cook something new. I'm thinking about making chilli. We'll see how it goes!<br /><br /><br /><br />",2023-05-18 19:51:38,üë®‚Äçüç≥,ccb3-cf76

We&rsquo;re two books in by now, and it&rsquo;s always fun to find new things to add to the story. Lately I&rsquo;ve been experimenting with chatGPT to help me drive my writing, and I&rsquo;ve had a wonderful insight: the bot does a great job at spitting out ideas and words, leaving me to focus on editing. The most important part of writing.</p><p>This is a wonderful realisation. Many writers agree that as fun as writing can be, it&rsquo;s often a slog. And editing is somehow even slower and even worse! It&rsquo;s amazing we ever get anything done.</p><p>What AI is showing me is that spitting out a rough outline of ideas onto the page isn&rsquo;t nearly as hard as crafting everything together. So it&rsquo;s doing me a great favour by forcing me to slow down and edit more. My work is getting better as a result.</p>",2022-12-29 19:48:23,üíª,c3ee-7819

246,I was wrong about Apple Vision,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/i-was-wrong-about-apple-vision/,"<p>The human mind is really good at changing its mind without realising it, so I want to jot down exactly what I was thinking before the Apple Vision announcement so I can learn from it. For context, the product was launched yesterday, about 36 hours ago.</p><p><strong>I was sure there would be backlash</strong></p><p>Don&#x2019;t get me wrong, I saw a lot of backlash. But I was expecting this to be the most laughed-at Apple product in my lifetime. I assumed it would succeed, if given enough years. I assumed it would be cool and approach the problem differently. But despite that, I still thought I&#x2019;d have to sift through 100 people explaining to me how bad the product is. Oddly, that hasn&#x2019;t happened.</p><p>Ben Thompson of Stratechery said &#x201C;It&#x2019;s far better than I expected, and I had high expectations,&#x201D; then wrote a <a href=""https://stratechery.com/2023/apple-vision/?ref=a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io"">long and detailed article</a> about how great it is. In my mind, he&#x2019;s the most insightful writer on the internet, so I&#x2019;d recommend anything he writes. But definitely this.</p><p>Marques Brownlee said the eye tracking and overall experience was the closest thing he&#x2019;s experienced to &#x201C;magic.&#x201D; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFvXuyITwBI&amp;ref=a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io"">His video</a> is about 20 minutes and it&#x2019;s also fantastic. It&#x2019;s clear that this is the Minority Report without so much arm strain.</p><p>MG Siegler <a href=""https://500ish.com/apples-vision-pro-meta-s-vision-oh-no-bf13a0ed83ba?ref=a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io"">ha&#x219; concluded</a> that it&#x2019;s game over for Meta&#x2019;s broader (more lucrative) aspirations for the metaverse, because Apple will absolutely dominate the scenarios it&#x2019;s aiming at. He recommends they aim at the low end of the market, around $500 or so, with a gaming focus. Because despite Apple&#x2019;s massive price umbrella, it&#x2019;s only a matter of time until Apple Vision gets cheaper, and his view, they nailed the basics in a way Meta didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>So yeah, there&#x2019;s backlash. But this might &#x2013; amazingly &#x2013; be the most positive early sentiment I&#x2019;ve seen for a new Apple product in my lifetime. I&#x2019;m serious. I expected the hater ratio to be 100 to 1, and at this point it&#x2019;s feeling more like 2 to 1. That&#x2019;s extraordinary.</p><p><strong>I was sure there wouldn&#x2019;t be eyeballs</strong></p><p>I just couldn&#x2019;t wrap my head around the idea that you&#x2019;d see eyes through the front. I envisioned Memoji eyes, but it just seemed too childish. I imagined they&#x2019;d just go with a flat surface, because I couldn&#x2019;t see any other options.</p><p>In hindsight, of course they went with a ski goggles look. The form factor is still unwieldy and heavy, but at least Apple isn&#x2019;t adding to the problem by adding googly eyes or worse.</p><p><strong>For some reason I expected VR</strong></p><p>Anyone that&#x2019;s heard me talk about VR/AR knows my whole script: I don&#x2019;t believe in &#x201C;putting my head in a fishbowl,&#x201D; which is what VR is. I do believe in overlaying information on the real world, which is what AR is. (Side note: I have studied these spaces for work and read lots of books, so these are educated opinions)</p><p>And yet, right up until I saw them, I assumed Apple was going with VR. I don&#x2019;t know why! I think I stopped thinking critically about the problem, and just assumed anyone making AR was going to have a stepping stone in VR-land. But if I had listened to my own gut, and recalled my own experiences with VR, I&#x2019;d have figured it out: VR sucks for most scenarios, and always will. Beat Saber is great, and so is playing No Man&#x2019;s Sky. But most other things are meh at best.</p><p>The key is to <em>start</em> from the assumption that people want to see the world, then provide immersion as an infrequent <em>option</em>. Everyone else did the opposite, assuming people want to start with their head in a fishbowl, and providing the option to maybe sometimes access a camera that shows what&#x2019;s in front of you. Everyone else was thinking backwards.</p><p><strong>I thought we&#x2019;d figured it all out</strong></p><p>I&#x2019;ve worked at design companies for a long time, and the AR/VR/Minority Report experiences come up a lot with clients. By the time Google Glass came out, I was jaded. &#x201C;Yeah,&#x201D; I thought. &#x201C;Looks good in a demo, but it will suck.&#x201D; Battery life, latency, apps, experience, technology searching for a problem, etc, I knew where the bodies were buried and I didn&#x2019;t think Google had the skill to pull it off. Later, my mom actually bought me Google Glass when they were on sale. I tried to turn down the gift, but she was persistent, so I got some. Good gravy they were bad. Worse than I expected.</p><p>Later, I was working on Windows Phone and HoloLens took some of our best designers away overnight. There were whispers that they had been whisked away to work on a &#x201C;wearable&#x201D; but we didn&#x2019;t know much. We didn&#x2019;t hear the name &#x201C;HoloLens&#x201D; for a while, but when it did come out, I was surprised by how limited and (sorry) lame the device was. The viewable area was limited. The interactions were bad. I couldn&#x2019;t imagine anyone loving it.</p><p>Oculus devices are good, but I couldn&#x2019;t ever figure out why I needed to spend my money on one. It felt best of class for a class that was not interesting.</p><p>So I figured Apple was going to make an Oculus, make it more expensive, connect it to live sports, and win. Which is part of what they&#x2019;re doing, but I failed to understand the scope of their ambition.</p><p><strong>I did not see this interface coming</strong></p><p>Seriously? You just look at the thing you want to manipulate and pinch your fingers together? THAT&#x2019;S the model? No controllers, no plans for controllers, no wide gesticulating in space or holding your hand to the side like Kinect? The entire interface is flicking, pinching, and <em>looking</em>?</p><p>I&#x2019;m a designer, so I&#x2019;d like to say I saw this coming. Especially after seeing Stage Manager and the way trackpads work on iPads. But I didn&#x2019;t. This is black magic, and the fact that people say it works well is hard to even comprehend.</p><p>Shout out to my fellow designers working on gestural/natural UIs for the last two decades. We laid the groundwork to find all the most clumsy and frustrating ways to attempt to interact with things in physical space, only for Apple to come by and say &#x201C;what if it&#x2019;s just looking and pinching?&#x201D; Good gravy.</p><p><strong>I was also wrong about iPhone</strong></p><p>I remember telling people in 2006 that if/when Apple made a phone, it would do far less than other phones, but look sexier doing it. I think I was imagining an iPod shuffle with a cellular plan. When they shipped an honest-to-goodness <em>hand computer</em> I was floored because I thought I knew Apple. Aren&#x2019;t they minimalistic? Sleek? Do fewer things, but better? Actually, no.</p><p>Apple tries to pack a Space Shuttle amount of technology into the smallest, fanless-ist, beautiful-ist package. That&#x2019;s what they did with iPhone, which is why I got things so wrong then. I think I made the same mistake this time. I knew Apple had great engineers and designers. I knew Apple zigs when other people zag. I know they won&#x2019;t release a product they think is half-baked. And yet I was still left reeling by the size of Apple&#x2019;s ambition when I saw this product. It&#x2019;s another reminder: when predicting what Apple will do, think big.</p>",2023-06-07 04:44:51,üí¨,0879-de12
269,The Quality Umbrella,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/the-quality-umbrella/,"<p>I agree with the conventional wisdom that Apple makes a &#x201C;price umbrella&#x201D; for its competition. If they&#x2019;re trying to sell a product at a high price point, and they refuse to make a cheaper version, that provides opportunity at lower price points. A tangible example is Apple selling phones for over $1000, which allows less expensive brands to market competing products as nearly as good but much cheaper. The same thing happened with Windows in the 80s and 90s. (And continues today)</p><p>But the price umbrella theory only works if the product is seen as a must-have, like a smartphone or computer. The same goes for internet access, streaming services, and cars. Most people can&#x2019;t get by without these products, so the marketplace is operating at scale, which pushes prices down. So when Apple sticks with its luxury pricing, there&#x2019;s plenty of space under their price umbrella. Look what has happened with Apple TV, for example. It&#x2019;s a better product than a Chromecast, but the product has very low marketshare. It&#x2019;s too expensive.</p><p>But the theory breaks down when you move from must-have products into nice-to-have ones. When Apple announced iPad, everyone wondered if there was room for an iPad in people&#x2019;s life. It did less than laptops, but was bigger than a phone. Was the product really necessary? Jobs addressed the elephant in the room when announcing the product, and oriented his entire pitch around it. It took years for iPad to justify its existence. It was, and is, a nice-to-have.</p><p>The same thing happened with Apple Watch. No one had been able to make wrist computers cool, and many early reviews agreed Apple hadn&#x2019;t pulled it off either. (Personally, I was very frustrated with the UI, the sluggishness, and the poor apps) It was expensive and hard to justify. It was a nice-to-have, so most people went without one. But over time Apple found success with it.</p><p>And now we have Apple Vision Pro. It is a quadrillion dollars, Apple&#x2019;s pitching it for use cases that no one has ever tried, and wearing a heavy face computer will never ever ever feel as natural as just holding a paperback sitting under a tree. It&#x2019;ll never feel natural to see the world through a screen, because it&#x2019;s not how we&#x2019;re wired. So can Apple Vision Pro even be considered a nice-to-have? Or is it extraordinarily cool tech that&#x2019;s destined to fail? I have an opinion.</p><p>First, I think it will succeed. But I&#x2019;d rather talk about failure, and the counter-intuitive point that Apple&#x2019;s failures with nice-to-have products are actually worse for its competition than it is for them.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve read about 100 articles explaining why the iPad had no reason to exist, or analysing its poor sales numbers, or talking about how it can never replace the laptop. The articles proved to be wrong (Apple sells over $7 billion in iPads per quarter), but let&#x2019;s imagine a world where they were right. If tablets were a flop, and not even Apple could make them desirable, even amongst rich gadget hounds, the would spell disaster for the low end. It would mean that even with cutting edge technology, the product is bad and nothing can save it. Not even a price cut.</p><p>The same goes for Apple Watch. It does quite well, with their &#x201C;Wearables, Home, and Accessories&#x201D; category making over $7 billion per quarter. But it&#x2019;s still a clunky wrist computer. In a world where Apple had failed to find success, it&#x2019;s hard to argue that the only issue was price and that Samsung would have cracked the nut.</p><p>The same will go for Apple Vision Pro. The price is eye-popping and the technology is untested. But if it fails, which it won&#x2019;t, first we&#x2019;ll have to parse what the word &#x201C;fails&#x201D; means. And from that, we can figure out how devastating its failure will be for its competitors.</p><p>Does something &#x201C;fail&#x201D; if it doesn&#x2019;t sell well in the first two years, which was the case for iPod and Watch, and in relative terms was also the case for iPhone? Or should we describe failure as something that&#x2019;s not making a billion dollars in revenue after a decade? Or perhaps the only bar we can set is whether or not the project is cancelled outright, a la the G4 Cube? Personally, I set the bar for failure for Apple Vision Pro at &#x201C;canceled or not profitable after five years,&#x201D; which is why I am supremely confident it will not fail on those terms. This product will never be canceled, and it&#x2019;s unfathomable for me to imagine five years of Apple iteration not resulting in a multi-billion dollar business.</p><p>But what of the competition? If Apple is selling seven billion dollars a a year (if not quarter), after five years, that&#x2019;s a lot of money, marketshare, and mindshare not going to other headsets. It&#x2019;s easy to call that bad news if you&#x2019;re competing against them. But how bad would it be if Apple can&#x2019;t even manage to make headway in the market? It would prove that not only are average people uninterested in VR at the low end of the nerd market, they&#x2019;re also uninterested <em>even when you push the technology as far as anyone&#x2019;s been able to push it.</em> It would mean the whole concept is a failure in the mainstream. It&#x2019;d mean we might be waiting a long time if we want face computers to be more than a nerd curiosity that excels at mostly games and porn. That would be devastating to everyone trying to make money in this space, not just Apple. Apple will always find some measure of success with wealthy and impulsive gadget hounds. Their competitors do not have that luxury.</p><p>I&#x2019;ll put it another way: Apple just showed us how headsets could look five years in the future, much like the original iPhone compared to Blackberry devices of their era. With iPhone, Apple got people to look at a futuristic and expensive product and decide it was for them. Then competition offered fewer bells and whistles at a lower price point and did well. But if they look at Apple Vision Pro decide they&#x2019;re not interested, no amount of price cuts would change that, which would be bad for the whole market.</p><p>But I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s going to happen. I think Apple Vision Pro will be an eventual hit and carve off the same massive advantage as Apple&#x2019;s hardware often enjoys, and they&#x2019;ll iterate from there, <a href=""https://daringfireball.net/2010/05/this_is_how_apple_rolls?ref=a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io"">as they do</a>.</p>",2023-06-21 23:32:29,üí¨,7790-b802

318,"6 October, 2023",https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/6-october-2023/,"<p>I have a lot of things on my mind, and sometimes I post them publicly. Here I go!</p><p>It&apos;s 7pm on a Friday and I&apos;m thinking about what my family is going to do tomorrow. I could take my kids on a bus, or maybe a train. We could go on a hike. We could lay around the house. We could go to a park. I&apos;m feeling compelled to plan something, because as a family we tend more towards laying around until noon and then wondering where the day went.</p><p>I have a series of digital hygiene tasks to address in my life. They&apos;re not necessarily interesting for anyone else to follow along with, but I need to write them all out so I can make progress on them.</p><p>First, my firehouse isn&apos;t automatically publishing very well. I&apos;d like to fix this once and for all, because it&apos;s never quite worked right. And I&apos;ve discovered that there&apos;s something motivating about a publish script that works: first you publish to make sure it&apos;s working. Then you publish again because something&apos;s on your mind. Before you know it, you can be in a publishing groove, and that&apos;s a good place to be.</p><p>Second, I have been writing a lot of tests for my personal projects, and I&apos;d like to write more. There&apos;s something enjoyable about writing up some simple checks against my code, knowing that when things break the robots will rush to tell me. And it helps that the work applies directly into the stuff I&apos;m doing at work right now.</p><p>Third, I have a bunch of blogs that I write but I&apos;ve been ignoring for a while. I have one about cooking, another about my academic career, and others I can&apos;t even remember right now. It might be nice to race through them and give status updates.</p><p>I played Starfield for a while, but my playthrough was cut short by a broken save file. I was fighting a boss, then I hit save. But then I died, and came back to life right before he blew me up. I did this loop a few times, and did a dumb thing, and now all my quicksaves are right before death. Meaning the entire game is broken for me now, other than a three week old save, for a game I&apos;ve had for four weeks. Bye bye, Starfield. Maybe I&apos;ll start something else, like, for example, writing more. It could happen!</p><p>New Zealand politics is in a pretty interesting place right now. I&apos;ve been thinking about writing an explainer for people who don&apos;t live in the country. There are some really interesting tidbits to share and analyse. We&apos;ll see.</p><p>I&apos;ve been working on my Master&apos;s thesis quite a bit. My favourite part is a gallery of ten software interactions that I&apos;m using to underscore the points in my essay. I&apos;ve done basic versions of 2 out of 10 of the pieces, and it&apos;d be nice to get to 10/10 as soon as possible. I&apos;m doing a novel thing with this work, and I can tell it will be well-received by the few people who see it.

304,"August 9th, 2023",https://academia.lot23.com/post/34,"I'm a month in, meaning I was supposed to send a draft proposal. And I did!<br /><br />Now I'm in the middle of the first month, where I am sprinting to write the entire 8k-30k (likely closer to 8k) draft in MVP form. That's going well too! I already have 4k words written. I'm going to post my proposal here for historical note taking. And below that I'm going to post a general outline of how my paper looks so far.<br /><br />--<br /><br />## Revised proposal<br /><br /><br />MASTERS OF DESIGN STUDY RESEARCH PROPOSAL¬†<br /><br />DRIL stream: Interaction and Design¬†<br /><br />Proposed Supervisor: Walter Langelaar¬†<br /><br />Funding (if applicable): N/A¬†<br /><br />External Partner/s (if applicable): N/A¬†<br /><br />Working Research Project title:¬†<br /><br />Augmented Text: A New Frontier in Responsive Communication¬†<br /><br />Project Overview:¬†<br /><br />My work will explore the exciting but overlooked space between standard text-based content and fully interactive software. Scholars and inventors as far back as Alan Kay (2003) have called for the creation of ‚Äúactive essays‚Äù and more recently Bret Victor has advocated for Explorable Explanations, (2011)¬†which inspired powerful new works such as the Pulitzer-winning Snowfall from the New York Times (2012). Still, the practice is outside the mainstream. My research will help the reader think about text as an interactive experience where writing isn‚Äôt just something to be consumed, but is instead an environment to think in.¬†<br /><br />Research Project Description:¬†<br /><br />My research will feature an survey of innovative and influential examples of augmented text to date. From these sources, I will distill core concepts, strategies, and approaches that have proven successful in engaging readers and enhancing understanding. The central focus of my work will be contributing to this under-appreciated field. I'll build a comprehensive pattern library featuring practical, applicable examples of augmented text techniques.¬†<br /><br />Each pattern in the library will be accompanied by working code and an interactive prototype. These will serve as a springboard for future exploration and innovation by designers and developers. This pattern library will stand as a practical, hands-on companion to the theoretical knowledge drawn from my research.¬†<br /><br />In this project, I am aiming to do more than just synthesize what has been done. I hope to inspire, enabling others to build on past achievements and explore new frontiers in the realm of responsive communication. After reading my work, readers will not only appreciate the art of what's been done in the past but will also be equipped to add to the future of augmented text and responsive communication.¬†<br /><br />Research Methods:¬†<br /><br />My research approach focuses on two primary methods: historical exploration and authoring a pattern library. To better understand the evolution of Augmented Text and Responsive Communication, I will conduct a survey of prominent examples in the field. This archival research will inform the development of a detailed timeline, placing each example within its historical and cultural context. By understanding the lineage of these techniques, we can glean insights into why certain methods have evolved, which have stood the test of time, and what patterns have emerged over the years.¬†<br /><br />The centerpiece of my research will be the development of an open-sourced pattern library. This practical, hands-on endeavor involves considerable design and development effort. The patterns will be drawn from the myriad examples identified in my historical survey, as well as from contemporary practices and my own design explorations. Each pattern in the library will be a real, working prototype, providing a tangible and interactive demonstration of the concept it represents. The pattern library will serve as both an encapsulation of current best practices and a tool for further exploration and innovation.¬†<br /><br />This approach combines historical research with practical design development. It allows me to both study the field as it has developed and contribute directly to its future. By applying what I learn from the historical survey to the creation of the pattern library, I aim to offer a comprehensive, practical, and forward-looking resource for those interested in Augmented Text and Responsive Communication. This process of active investigation and creation provides a rich understanding of the field and lays the groundwork for future research and design advancements.¬†<br /><br />Research Outputs:¬†<br /><br />The centerpiece of this research will be a comprehensive research paper, spanning between 8,000 to 30,000 words, that lays out the history, theory, and application of Augmented Text and Responsive Communication. This document will be available in PDF form for traditional academic consumption.¬†<br /><br />However, to fully embrace the topic of study, the same content will be presented as an interactive online essay. This digital rendition will incorporate live examples of augmented text and responsive communication, creating an experiential learning environment for readers and embodying the principles it discusses.¬†<br /><br />Complementing the research paper, I will also produce an open-sourced pattern library. This practical resource will host a collection of interactive patterns drawn from my research, each one a fully functioning example of Augmented Text. It is my hope that this pattern library will not only illustrate the concepts discussed in the research paper but will also serve as a source of inspiration and a toolkit for other designers and developers venturing into this exciting frontier of digital communication.¬†<br /><br />Research Plan:¬†<br /><br />Month 1 (MVP)¬†<br /><br />With the knowledge already gained in the field, a preliminary draft of the entire research paper will be constructed. This is a methodology that has proven successful in industry settings‚Äîcreate a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) quickly and proceed to iterate based on its foundation. This is non-standard, because a literature review typically comes first, but I think this will give me the best chance of success because it gives me more time to iterate.¬†<br /><br />Months 2-4 (Development)¬†<br /><br />Pattern Library Development (Month 2-4) The next three months will be dedicated to writing code for the pattern library. Leveraging the insights from the initial draft, a series of interactive examples showcasing the potential of augmented text and responsive communication will be developed. By the end of this phase, a concrete vision of the research's direction, inclusive of the practical example library, will be achieved.¬†<br /><br />Months 5-7 (Literature and peer review)¬†<br /><br />In these three months, the paper and code examples will be scrutinized, iterated upon, and improved. The draft research paper will be shared with peers and experts for their feedback. In parallel, a literature review will be conducted to understand how the project relates to, deviates from, and augments the existing body of knowledge.¬†<br /><br />Months 8-9 (Iteration)¬†<br /><br />Taking into account the new learnings, feedback, and insights from the previous phase, the paper and the code examples will be revised, refined, and expanded upon. This iterative process ensures the research paper and the pattern library are at the cutting edge of the field and provide substantial contribution.¬†<br /><br />Months 10-12 (Refinement)¬†<br /><br />The final three months will serve as bonus time to polish all aspects of the research. This phase includes the final revisions of the paper, fine-tuning of the code examples, addressing any remaining feedback or uncovered issues, and preparing for the final submission. This period provides an opportunity to ensure that the research stands up to the rigors of academic scrutiny while remaining a practical and useful contribution to the field.¬†<br /><br />Material, Equipment, and Workshop Requirements:¬†<br /><br />[none planned at this time]¬†<br /><br />Reference list:¬†<br /><br />Kay, A.

319,How to win,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/how-to-win/,"<p>In the car with my son today, I started a political lesson by saying &#x201C;this is going to sound cynical, but I promise I am trying to tell you something true, without cynicism.&#x201D; Then I proceeded to explain a scheme that&#x2019;s so deeply cynical that anyone who even tries to analyse it is tainted just by association. It&#x2019;s how you win elections as a stock conservative, at least as much as I&#x2019;ve seen happen in the United States and New Zealand. The grand strategy is simple to explain, and it works, and yes, it&#x2019;s deeply cynical. But that&#x2019;s their fault, not mine. I&#x2019;m trying to be fair and reasonable, even if they&#x2019;re not.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s the strategy: you cut taxes and cut programs. If you&#x2019;re out of power, you talk about wasteful spending. If you&#x2019;re the party in power, you talk about how we can&#x2019;t afford to go back to the old &#x201C;tax and spend&#x201D; ways. That&#x2019;s the entire strategy, and it works. Cut taxes and cut programs. Easy.</p><p>To be clear, we&#x2019;re in a democracy, so if more people vote for your plan, it is better, by definition. There are other definitions, like if your policies help society in the long run, but all that comes later. In the heat of a political campaign during an election season, your only goal is to get more people believing in your vision. A great vision means nothing if no one votes for it. The worst vision in the world can&#x2019;t reasonably be described as worst if more people vote for it than the alternative. So I am sympathetic to the &#x201C;cut taxes, cut programs&#x201D; approach, purely on the merits of how often it works. But I do hate it as a policy because I&#x2019;ve watched it fail many times.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s a metaphor. Rebecca the homeowner says her house needs repairs. One contractor comes by and gives her a quote for repairs. Other contractor comes by and offers her a $500 voucher. She takes the $500 voucher, and then returns home to discover that the contractor removed the roof off her home in exchange for the voucher. In this metaphor, the left is the contractor quoting for repairs. Fixing society&#x2019;s problems costs money, after all. In this metaphor, the right is the contractor offering a voucher to steal your roof, leaving you worse off. It&#x2019;s nice getting $500. It&#x2019;s nicer to have a roof over your head.</p><p>This is why the most important thing, if you&#x2019;re trying to push the $500 voucher approach to government, is to never talk about the roof you&#x2019;ll be stealing. You need to explain, at great length, how great the $500 will feel in your pocket. How those greedy contractors that are trying to &#x201C;fix problems&#x201D; for &#x201C;long term benefit&#x201D; are just grifters that can&#x2019;t be trusted. How they&#x2019;ve never done anything right anyway, and hey, did we mention $500? It&#x2019;s $500! Hire us! Who doesn&#x2019;t want $500?</p><p>You must never, under any circumstances, explain the specifics of how you&#x2019;re going to hand over that $500 voucher. You can&#x2019;t talk about taking the roof, because people like their roof. You can&#x2019;t mention gutting the plumbing or stripping the copper from the electrical system. That&#x2019;ll just freak people out. No, you just have to talk over and over about &#x201C;efficiency&#x201D; and &#x201C;cutting costs&#x201D; and that sort of thing. Everyone wants to cut costs. They just don&#x2019;t want to lose their roof, so you don&#x2019;t mention that part until later, when it&#x2019;s too late.</p><p>I live in New Zealand, and the party on the right (here they&#x2019;re called National, in America they&#x2019;d be called Republicans) is about to win the upcoming election and take over the government from Labour (in America, they&#x2019;d be called Democrats) and they&#x2019;re following the same old playbook. They&#x2019;re saying the government is charging too much, and that everyone deserves a hefty tax cut. But a few days ago they made a rookie mistake by actually admitting how they&#x2019;ll pay for their plan. And the thinking is just as magical as Trump or George W Bush.</p><p>They are going to raid the budget for $14 billion dollars. To pay for it, are they asking for a capital gains tax, which most other developed countries adopted long ago? Of course not. They&#x2019;re paying for their $14 billion tax cut like this:<br></p><ul><li>$2.356b in &#x201C;bureaucracy savings&#x201D;</li><li>$2.119b in &#x201C;closing Labour programs&#x201D;</li><li>$1.6b in &#x201C;contractor savings&#x201D;</li><li>$2.228b from the &#x201C;climate dividend&#x201D;</li></ul><p>(<a href=""https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/300980103/five-things-to-know-about-national-and-labours-fiscal-policies?ref=a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io"">Source</a>)</p><p>You should notice a few things here. First, those total $8.3b, which is only 59% of the number they need to reach for this to be revenue neutral. Second, those first three are meaningless. They&#x2019;re just swinging a magic wand and saying &#x201C;Shazam! We&#x2019;ll discover $6 billion if we just put our mind to it!&#x201D; Which, sure. They will. They&#x2019;ll metaphorically sell the roof off the house, but they certainly don&#x2019;t want to admit that yet.</p><p>Which brings us to the &#x201C;climate dividend.&#x201D; It turns out this plan is so underhanded and wrong that both the far-right (ACT) and the far-left (Green) parties are both <a href=""https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/496899/greens-act-cry-foul-over-national-s-climate-dividend?ref=a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io"">equally angry about it</a>. The climate dividend is money put aside after charging big business for polluting. The spirit of the fund is to either distribute the money back to people, as a way of saying &#x201C;We are working to address climate change by billing polluters, and here&#x2019;s your share of those profits&#x201D; or by simply taking that money and directly making investments in green energy at the government level. Both would be fine, but National is choosing a third option. They&#x2019;re just taking that cash, adding it to the general government fund, and using it to power their tax cuts for the rich. Gross.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve seen this movie before. I wish I hadn&#x2019;t. I wish I could be naively optimistic that giving everyone a $500 voucher wouldn&#x2019;t mean we&#x2019;re selling the roof of our house. But I won&#x2019;t be fooled by this again. The country&#x2019;s mood will eventually pivot from being frustrated about how Labour hasn&#x2019;t done enough to how National has made everything worse. But in the meantime, hey, a $500 voucher! Everyone grab yours! But bundle up, the roof is gone and winter is coming.</p>",2023-09-30 08:46:46,üí¨,4169-84c5
320,Shy AI Creatives,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/shy-ai-creatives/,"<p>There&#x2019;s a concept in modern-day political polling of &#x201C;shy Trump voters&#x201D; that intend to vote for Trump but don&#x2019;t want to mention it. So this means his polling is always a bit lower than his actual support levels. On the other hand, we have people who love Trump, and proclaim it loudly. And I think people using chatGPT in a creative context might have a similar issue. Some people are loudly proclaiming how great it is, but I think far, far more people are quietly using it and not interested in stirring up a backlash.</p><p>I seem to run into 10 skeptics for every person openly admitting they&#x2019;re finding real value from AI. Some of my friends have written it off. Some of my coworkers have aggressively called us out for using AI-generated art, which led to a lengthy and anguished response from me, the company&#x2019;s head of design, about where and when we will use AI.</p><p>(Tangent: My argument boils down to the idea that I&#x2019;ve been in the field for nearly 25 years, and I can remember my teams paying for a photo or illustration twice. Most of the other time we&#x2019;ve used free stock photography, just like how must people raid images.google.com for their Powerpoint presentation rather than setting up a film shoot. This, combined with the idea that of course you shouldn&#x2019;t purposely scrape an artist&#x2019;s work to make rip-offs of their art, combined into our stance that we were going to use AI art, despite understanding the backlash)</p><p>But I&#x2019;m here to tell you that creatives in your life are absolutely using AI, and they just don&#x2019;t want to tell you about it. It&#x2019;s similar to when Twitter came out and no one could understand that it was more than &#x201C;what you had for lunch.&#x201D; Or that blogs could exist about anything other than &#x201C;navel gazing.&#x201D; I know I&#x2019;m going to lose my audience when I say it here, but it&#x2019;s the same reflexive mindset that is surprised (and maybe a little concerned) to see a woman pilot. It is the same thing, even though you&#x2019;ll want to argue with me. It&#x2019;s all one simple little word, one that causes the most damage when we think we&#x2019;re safe from it. That word is ignorance. If you don&#x2019;t know, you don&#x2019;t know, and you pretend you do.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s clear up some misconceptions. First, the idea that it&#x2019;s just mindlessly putting one word after the other is simultaneously true and completely missing the point. Yes, that&#x2019;s how the technology works, but if that&#x2019;s your mental model you&#x2019;re not going to understand how significant the technology is.</p><p>If I ask Google &#x201C;Do you have suggestions for writing E2E tests for my web app?&#x201D; then I will get a list of ten articles, as you&#x2019;d expect. If I ask the same question of chatGPT, it starts with some popular tools, then general steps, then writes a sample test for me (with install instructions), then shares best practices, then asks if I have any specific questions it can help me with. <a href=""https://chat.openai.com/share/dcac9818-4a65-468f-a88e-3b4cd1bbc467?ref=a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io"">See the response here</a>. One word after the other? Sure. Just like how Romeo and Juliet is just a love story. This is missing the point.</p><p>Second, hallucinations, the word used to say AI makes things up. In the popular imagination people seem to think chatGPT is spewing garbage, then humans are copy/pasting responses without looking them over, and then submitting entire wrong answers to the judge overseeing their case or the teacher teaching their class. And that has happened, to be sure. But there&#x2019;s a much more interesting story lurking beneath that one, which is that there&#x2019;s a universe of value you can get from things that have no single right answer.</p><p>For example, let&#x2019;s say I&#x2019;m writing jokes with a comedy writing partner. We&#x2019;re bouncing ideas off each other and I ask my friend &#x201C;I feel like there&#x2019;s a joke in here somewhere where we talk about systematic racism in Hollywood in a way that really makes the audience think. Maybe we can bring in Mel Gibson? Maybe there&#x2019;s a Will Smith angle?&#x201D; and from there we&#x2019;d riff. Well, I proposed the same thing to chatGPT and it did a fantastic job. <a href=""https://chat.openai.com/share/49586a50-f5e3-4e75-8eeb-a17cde6e375c?ref=a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io"">See the response here</a>.</p><p>In this response, chatGPT outlines five themes to explore and then gives a few proposed jokes to help illustrate the point. Are the jokes good? Would I use them verbatim? Well, no. But are they going in the right direction? Could that 10 second query provide me with more forward progress than a one hour brainstorm? Absolutely yes. chatGPT isn&#x2019;t for objectively right answers. It works really well to bounce ideas and iterate on concepts, so the criticism that &#x201C;sometime it gets facts wrong&#x201D; is obscuring the real story.</p><p>Third, the idea that all creatives are against AI is just wrong. They are much more concerned about being canceled or ignored and right now there&#x2019;s not a lot of benefit to admitting you&#x2019;re using a tool people think is evil and bad. Saying you use AI makes you sound immoral, lazy, and maybe an NFT scam bro. So there&#x2019;s not a lot of advantage to mentioning it, so people think the whole creative world is against it. We&#x2019;re not, and I can prove it. It&#x2019;ll just take a few years for people to look back and admit that they too were once a shy AI creative, back in the early days of 2023. But we&#x2019;re not there yet.</p>",2023-09-23 06:21:09,üí¨,ad24-ea4f

Here‚Äôs the code you want to¬†write:</p><pre>import clientPromise from &quot;../../../lib/mongodb&quot;;<br>import { ObjectId } from &quot;mongodb&quot;;<br><br>export default async (req, res) =&gt; {<br>  const { id } = req.query;<br><br>  try {<br>    const client = await clientPromise;<br>    const db = client.db(&quot;sample_mflix&quot;);<br>    const movies = await db<br>      .collection(&quot;movies&quot;)<br>      .find({ _id: ObjectId(id) })<br>      .toArray();<br><br>    res.json(movies);<br>  } catch (e) {<br>    console.error(e);<br>  }<br>};</pre><p>And you‚Äôd put that in a file called /pages/api/movie/[id].js.</p><p>For SEO reasons, I am going to copy/paste the homework challenge text to help other people who might hit this¬†wall:</p><blockquote>As a homework exercise, why don‚Äôt you create an API route that returns a single movie based on a user provided¬†id?</blockquote><blockquote>To give you some pointers, you‚Äôll use <a href=""https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/dynamic-api-routes"">Next.js Dynamic API Routes</a> to capture the id. So if a user calls <a href=""http://localhost:3000/api/"">http://localhost:3000/api/</a> movies/ 573a1394f29313caabcdfa3e the movie that should be returned is <strong>Seven Samurai</strong>. Another tip, the _id property for the sample_mflix database in MongoDB is stored as an ObjectID, so you&#39;ll have to convert the string to an ObjectID. If you get stuck, create a thread on the <a href=""https://developer.mongodb.com/community/forums/"">MongoDB Community forums</a> and we&#39;ll solve it together! Next, we&#39;ll take a look at how to access our MongoDB data within our Next.js¬†pages.</blockquote><p>The problem with this is even searching Google, Stack Overflow, and other sources, it turns out a lot of people are confused by this. I wasn‚Äôt able to find a single answer, so here you go! I eventually cracked it by finding a <a href=""https://gist.github.com/codeSTACKr/53fd03c7f75d40d07797b8e4e47d78ec#find-all-documents"">Mongo cheat¬†sheet</a>.</p><p>Writing good documentation is hard, but it should never require someone to do homework to get core information. In this example, the docs explain how to return lots of things from the DB, but not one. So if you‚Äôre making a blog, the docs explain how to pull down <em>every</em> blog post but don‚Äôt explain how to load <em>one</em>.

113,Using the blog wrong,https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=51090,"
<p>So there's this great thing called PICO-8, which is referred to as a &quot;fantasy console.&quot; You can go and play all sorts of games on the PICO-8, or you can make your own game. It's pretty great.</p>
<p>Part of this community is a blogging system, so I got an account. I don't write games, but I figured this would be a cool place to write about technical things that I'm building and excited about. Even if they're not PICO-8 or related to games.</p>
<p>So, tonight my excitement is that I got an RSS feed working that pulls from multiple sources. It's a pretty cool concept. And now I hope this post appears in it.</p>

362,Some Recent Projects I Want to Remember,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/some-recent-projects-i-want-to-remember/,"<p>Go into any inventor&#x2019;s lab, physical or figurative, and you&#x2019;ll find projects in different stages of development. For each thing that&#x2019;s ready to share, there are often dozens of little experiments and explorations tucked into nooks and crannies. Some of my biggest successes were things I set aside for a few months or years before spotting them in the corner of the workshop, dusting them off, giving them a new paint job, and sharing them with the world. Here are some things on my mind lately, many of which may slip between the cracks if I don&#x2019;t write them down.</p><ol><li>Simon Willison is amazing, and he has a <a href=""https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/claude-hacker-news-themes?ref=a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io"">great post</a> about summarising Hacker News threads with AI. He uses Claude and I&#x2019;m using chatGPT. He&#x2019;s pointing to Hacker News and I want to point to Metafilter. But I have a little demo working and it&#x2019;s pretty great.</li><li>Last year (or was it two years ago?) I recorded an entire concept album. It&#x2019;s actually pretty good. I enjoy listening to it. I have dreams of releasing it as a multimedia website experience, so you can follow along with the story while listening to the songs.</li><li>I have an image hosting app called Piccadilly that lets me put a file in a folder and have it appear on the internet. I want to make an expanded version for adding text beside it. I got it half working, and it&#x2019;d be good to pick back up again soon.</li><li>I&#x2019;ve been making tarot cards for my little invented religion. The next thing I need to do is buy a standard deck of cards (empty ones would be even better) so I can start play-testing what my set should be comprised of.</li><li>I&#x2019;ve been writing vignettes for the fantasy stories I do for my kids. It&#x2019;s been going great, and I have a tiny collection I&#x2019;d like to add to when I get a chance.</li><li>My grandpa just passed. Fortunately he wrote a book about his 101-year life, including working at the legendary Bell Labs. I&#x2019;ve scanned the pages, OCR&#x2019;d them, and now I&#x2019;m fixing typos from the OCR process. I&#x2019;d like to make this into a website. Even better: links out to the stuff he refers to, such as being involved in the Berlin Airlift, his patents, locations of his childhood home from the 20s, and so forth.</li><li>I want to analyse my use of chatGPT over the first year (technically the first 13 months or so). It&#x2019;s possible to download all chatGPT conversations, so I&#x2019;d love to see how I&#x2019;ve used it. I&#x2019;m thinking of starting with simply dividing code questions from non-code questions, then showing in a simple infographic. Maybe code is a green dot and everything else is blue dot. I&#x2019;m thinking of doing this today.</li><li>I&#x2019;ve been doing a lot of financial analysis stuff since it&#x2019;s the end of the year. I have a custom spreadsheet that I&#x2019;m enjoying reconciling, categorising, and finding trends from. This is a priority today and this week.</li><li>A few weeks ago I was practicing my illustration skills. It&#x2019;s been a while since I posted something on Instagram, so maybe I should.</li><li>I&#x2019;d like to hang a TV on the wall of my office so it&#x2019;s easy to load up a movie or something without it being a floating window in my workspace. I&#x2019;ve been idly thinking about how that might work.</li><li>My son is getting back into Mariokart in a big way. I enjoy playing with him, and I&#x2019;m looking forward to carving out some time for us to hang out.</li><li>I&#x2019;ve been reading actual, physical copies of books! Imagine! I need to set aside time to read them or I&#x2019;ll never get back to them.</li><li>I&#x2019;ve been improving my firehose app and I&#x2019;m pretty close to having permalinks so I can start owning my own content with my own URLs. I&#x2019;m seeing some strange bugs I gotta fix in order to get this working.</li><li>I recently wrote a blog post about the last 12-18 months of design decisions at my startup where I&#x2019;m the founding designer. I should finish that up and publish it.</li><li>I should update my backups and projects folders.</li><li>My thesis is going pretty well, but I do need to define the next several weeks of work. I also need to congratulate myself appropriately for how well I hit my previous two targets, to help motivate the next ones.</li></ol><p>One of my life hacks is writing big lists like this and then purposely telling myself not to work on most of them. I know the things on this list that need to happen next. Which means I am saying good bye to the other ones. For now.</p>",2024-01-01 20:15:42,üí¨,2fbc-1d45
32,A Head Injury,https://jonb.tumblr.com/post/710279240944353280,"<p>Our ragteam soccer team (named with a pun riffing on the term &ldquo;Expected to Lose&rdquo;) was playing a slightly less ragteam team (named with a pun for &ldquo;Zero Goals&rdquo;) was down by one point and there were only 30 seconds left in the match, enough for one more shot on goal. And I had the ball rolling ahead of me with no one near it.</p><p>There were only two of us that could get to the ball in time. Me, a weak player who normally plays defense, and the other team&rsquo;s goalie, who was heroically coming far beyond where a goalie normally would play. The ball was just barely too far for either of us to reach in time, so we both sprinted as hard as we could.</p><p>Then there was an impact, I was spinning through the air in a rag doll pirouette, my heel hurt, and then ker-thud I landed on my head. It&rsquo;s possible I first landed on my shoulder. I don&rsquo;t remember what happened. A crowd formed around me telling me to stay down. I waited there on my hands and knees. My head didn&rsquo;t hurt that much, so I said &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gotten concussions before, this is not a concussion&rdquo; and stood up. Someone asked me what day it was and I said &ldquo;Uhhhh&rdquo; which made everyone laugh, because half said they didn&rsquo;t actually know either.</p><p>I asked what happened. I was going for a shot, and I think I took one. &ldquo;Wow mate, are you sure you didn&rsquo;t hit your head?&rdquo; I said in the collision I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to see what happened. But I did take a shot, right? It turns out I had. In fact, it almost went in, only missing because it ricocheted off the top bar as time ran out.</p><p>Pretty cool for someone who never takes shots on goal.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t wait to try again next week.</p>",2023-02-26 01:31:09,üíª,126e-f441
38,"You Know What, Tumblr Is Pretty Great",https://jonb.tumblr.com/post/706374328520949760,"<p>I have a lot of Tumblr accounts. The oldest one I can find is from this account, where I wrote this in April 2007:</p><p class=""npf_quote"">Everyone in the world is talking about Tumbler. ¬†I think this is my second account.</p><p>I know I&rsquo;m preaching to the choir when it comes to die-hard Tumblr folks, but Tumblr is pretty great. Even now. Especially now.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about its place in the history of blogging and online culture, and here&rsquo;s how I experienced it:</p><ul><li>In the late 80s, you&rsquo;d connect with people via BBS, Prodigy, Compuserve, AOL, and so forth.</li><li>In the 90s, we got things like Geocities.</li><li>During the first big internet boom of the late 90s/early 00s, we got stuff like Blogger and Moveable Type. (I wrote my own blogging software that some people actually used!)</li><li>A lot of people talk about the heyday during the 2000s where it seemed like everyone was blogging and reading stuff with RSS Readers. There was also lots of link sharing with del.icio.us and similar services.</li><li>And then &hellip; Twitter happened.</li></ul><p>Blogging had already been slowing down, but then it really took a nosedive. Same with RSS readers. Same with link-sharing as a mainstream activity you do through del.icio.us.</p><p>And yet, through it all, there was this scrappy other site called Tumblr. It was way easier to set up than something like Moveable Type. The quality and depth you could find was better than something like Blogger. The ability to send things out and have them get amplified through the system felt really powerful and good.</p><p>I&rsquo;m really glad Tumblr is still kicking. I&rsquo;m really glad the plans for it seem to be on more stable ground than in some years past. And sort of like a forest fire having some positive side effects, I&rsquo;m looking for some new growth to grow in the hellfire that is Twitter&rsquo;s collapse.</p><p>And hey, I can help with my own little contributions. Like this post, and like my new project I call <a href=""http://firehose.lot23.com/"">Firehose</a> that is an RSS feeder of all the places I do things online. Including this post.</p>",2023-01-13 23:04:14,üíª,f947-3133

227,Writer‚Äôs Workshop: 1 mile range,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/writers-workshop-1-mile-range/,"<p>A premise can be interesting, but the execution is everything. Romeo and Juliet is just a story of two people in love. Star Wars is just a space opera. The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress is just a story about revolution. But as important as a premise may be to inspire the author or hook the reader, the real magic is in how well the story itself unfolds.</p><p>Today I&#x2019;d like to take you on a journey in a space in between a premise and a fully-fledged story: the brainstorming and imaginative play that goes on while you&#x2019;re moving from idea to an early draft. Take a premise like &#x201C;Snakes on a Plane&#x201D; as an example. We know there are snakes. We know they&#x2019;re on a plane. So? What boundaries and parameters are we going to put around it? Will there be a hero? What is the conflict? Why can&#x2019;t they just land the plane? This is where all the good stuff comes out, and it&#x2019;s a lot of fun to dream up.</p><p><br>Today&#x2019;s premise is &#x201C;a world where people can only go one mile from their birthplace.&#x201D; Let me explain why.</p><p>My friend and I were discussing how science fiction often treats the vastness of space the way seafarers in the 1600s might. In these stories, everything, no matter how far away, is reachable if given enough time. So you have stories where a trip from India to England is technically possible, even if it&#x2019;s dangerous and slow. And shows like Star Trek have the same back of the envelope calculation. It might be super far, and it might take some time, but everything is possible. The laws of physics don&#x2019;t support this, of course. If we wrote science fiction to strictly align with what we think is physically possible, journeys would rarely go out of a single solar system. Which is sort of boring. But does it have to be? Or is it just different? And that&#x2019;s where I hatched up the idea of a world where everyone has to stay within a mile of their home.</p><p><strong>Brainstorm #1: time frame</strong></p><p>Would the story illustrate modern life with this limitation, or go back to prehistoric times? Both could be interesting, but gosh, modern life would be so much harder to explain. Maybe the story actually explores civilisation over time? How epic.</p><p><strong>Brainstorm #2: have things always been this way?</strong></p><p>Overnight switches are dramatic. Imagine describing life in 2023 where all of the sudden everyone further than a mile from their home was affected. Gosh, that would probably be 99% of the planet, right? Or at least 80%? I have no idea. But you could write the story as if things have always been this way, so it wouldn&#x2019;t be as much of a shift.</p><p><strong>Brainstorm #3: how does it affect people?</strong></p><p>A situation where everyone gets a tummy-ache is quite different to one where people erupt in flames. Maybe you get more and more blind the further you go? Maybe you drop dead after a day? How severe should it be?</p><p><strong>Brainstorm #4: are there any exceptions?</strong></p><p>If 10% of the population can move freely but 90% can&#x2019;t, that&#x2019;s an angle. Or if the split is 50/50, that&#x2019;s a completely different story. Or maybe it&#x2019;s 100%, and then our hero is, for some reason, the only person known to be immune? How would they discover they had the power? Is that too trope-y and obvious? Or is a &#x201C;chosen one&#x201D; angle strong because it&#x2019;s so well travelled in literature?</p><p><strong>Brainstorm #5: what causes it?</strong></p><p>Maybe the story never addresses what causes this strange world to exist. Or maybe it does? Maybe once the characters learn what&#x2019;s causing the problem, they can fix it? Maybe that would be in a book two?</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p><strong>Putting it all together</strong></p><p>I threw out a lot of variables there. Isn&#x2019;t it cool to imagine that you could write 50 different stories off this one world-building premise just by tweaking variables one way or another? I think that&#x2019;s super inspiring. But let me pluck out my favourite approaches from each of these and see what we&#x2019;ve got.</p><ol><li>I want to go back to prehistoric times</li><li>Things have always been this way</li><li>People feel worse, physically and emotionally, the further they go</li><li>It happens to everyone</li><li>The story doesn&#x2019;t address why</li></ol><p>And I&#x2019;d also add that I don&#x2019;t have characters in mind. I don&#x2019;t have a moral to the story. I don&#x2019;t have an ending. I don&#x2019;t have a plan other than wanting to discover how this world feels to live in. And that&#x2019;s more than enough to get started with.</p>",2023-05-22 10:03:04,üí¨,0d05-a9e6

273,A Guide to Having Fun in America,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/a-guide-to-having-fun-in-america/,"<p>This is a misleading title, because it makes it sound like I have some wisdom to impart about other people having fun in America. I do not. Instead, the title is what I&#x2019;ve decided to use as a journaling technique for myself. Let&#x2019;s dive in!</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>I&#x2019;ve been living in New Zealand for about half and a half years with my family. We have no intention to live in America agin. We&#x2019;re permanent residents of New Zealand, we have roots, and those roots are growing. This makes America a novelty for us. &#x201C;Oh,&#x201D; we think to ourselves when looking at Aurora in Seattle or &#x201C;American-style diners&#x201D;, as the rest of the world calls them. &#x201C;I remember this.&#x201D; Sometimes we miss a detail, sometimes we&#x2019;re happy to be done with it, but it always feels a bit removed. Like tapping your teeth after a Novocaine shot. I can sense that I&#x2019;m touching something, but the two-way feeling is gone.</p><p>I took this same business trip last year, and went big on nostalgia. I walked by the apartment I used to live in, then the local Main Street. I chased down old haunts to see what was still open and what had closed. Nearly everything had closed, in some cases only a few months prior. It was the same old thing as before, sometimes with new stores, sometimes just empty storefronts. I spent days doing this in various towns, and the feeling was always the same. Like walking down the now-small corridors of your old high school and hearing that your homeroom teacher had died.</p><p>I took a wide drive out to Pt Reyes at night to hear the frogs and the next day went out to Bolinas. I listened to audiobooks and felt the warmth of the Bay Area in June. In New Zealand, June is December cold. It feels like cheating to experience sweat, and swimming pools, and ice cream in June again. &#x201C;I remember this,&#x201D; I kept saying to myself. Did I like it? Did I like the idea of it? Did I like the memory of it? Was the whole thing just sad and desperate? I couldn&#x2019;t quite tell, but I kept flicking my tongue against my Novocained memories.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>So I think the way forward, not only for this trip but any trips I take to America in the future, is to find more ways to look forward. It was fun aimlessly walking down the streets I used to know, and I wouldn&#x2019;t be opposed to doing it again. But it&#x2019;s better for those moments to be incidental, not sought-out. I need to figure out what the United States of America means to me today and build from there.</p><p>I&#x2019;ll be landing at 6am on Saturday, and by 9am I have a visit planned with a close friend&#x2019;s family. I have another visit scheduled in the early afternoon, and then I have nothing planned for the rest of the day. Sandra Bernhardt has a show, the San Francisco Giants have a game, and there are plenty of other things going on. I could take part in those, and I probably will. I have a little bit of shopping to do, but not a lot. I could see a movie, which is something I could do in any country, and that would be a big part of the appeal.</p><p>I think I have an opportunity to make meals into tentpoles for the whole trip. Maybe I can set up lunch and dinner for myself ahead of time, then allow the remaining time to be casual and unhurried. That sounds nice.</p><p>The next day, Sunday, is gonna be a lot. I have three separate social events planned, all with people important to me. All the reason to make sure Saturday is calm and nourishing. Familiar. Forward-looking.</p><p>Then I have a week of corporate offsite stuff. That&#x2019;s going to take a lot out of me, then I have another Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. I&#x2019;ll be staying with close family friends at their place, and absolutely nothing is planned. I&#x2019;ll just be at their house, as a roommate, with nothing at all planned. Like David Byrne pointed out once, heaven is a place where nothing happens.</p><p><br>Then late on Sunday night, I&#x2019;ll get on a plane, travel far across the Pacific, and appreciate the time to decompress. That&#x2019;s how I&#x2019;ll have fun in America, by being who I am rather than who I was. That&#x2019;s how I&#x2019;ll keep my head straight, by doing nothing rather than doing everything. In many ways, this might be the first trip I experience as a New Zealander rather than an American. The idea of that makes me feel calmer already.</p>",2023-06-23 05:40:44,üí¨,704e-6710
282,I've officially begun!,https://academia.lot23.com/post/32,"Good progress since my last update in California. I've officially officially started, I've sent along a draft research proposal to my advisor, he thinks it looks good, and now I'm updating some minor things to make it final. I'm way ahead of schedule and feeling good.<br /><br />I did a slightly different thing in my proposal that I think will pay off nicely. Instead of spending the first three months doing background research, I'm going to give myself a month to write the entire paper at an MVP level. I'd much rather race through an MVP in a month and leave myself eleven months for editing than what most people do: background research, procrastination, freak out, cram at the end, don't edit enough. So this will set things up really well.<br /><br />A nice side benefit is that I'm really motivated to dive in. If I only have a month, I might as well get going!",2023-07-08 09:21:12,üéì,3e4c-aa5f

I turned my attention to other things.<br /><br />I don't like to have unfinished business, so it'd be nice to have all those screenshots categorised as I originally intended. But I have a finite number of hours, so I want to use them well. And right now I don't need to categorise Explorables. I need to focus on other topics. So I'm purposely leaving it. I have other tasks that I'm leaving too.<br /><br />I think if I were doing this in my 20s, I'd be brute forcing everything.

58,Can Trump Win as an Independent?,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/can-trump-win-as-an-independent/,"<p>I&#x2019;m the guy my friends reach out to in order to get a quick summary of a political situation so they don&#x2019;t have to spend time researching it themselves. So that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m going to do today to answer this question: can Trump run as a third party candidate in 2024? The answer is: yes he can, and there&#x2019;s zero chance he&#x2019;d win. Ze-ro. The math doesn&#x2019;t work thanks to &#x201C;sore loser laws.&#x201D;</p><p><a href=""https://www.harvard-jlpp.com/if-you-aint-first-youre-last-how-state-sore-loser-laws-make-it-impossible-for-trump-to-run-a-successful-third-party-campaign-if-he-loses-the-rep/?ref=a-blog-about-jon-bell"">Here&#x2019;s a lengthy study</a> that goes through all the data, but the summary is simple. If Donald Trump loses the Republican nomination, a bunch of states will bar him from running as a third party candidate. Far too many to math the electoral math work. For example, here&#x2019;s what Texas&#x2019; law says, with a whopping 40 electoral votes:<br></p><p><em>&#x201C;a candidate in a presidential primary election is ineligible to be an independent candidate for president . . . in the succeeding general election.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Translation: if you run as a Republican in the primary, you cannot run as a third party in the general election. It&#x2019;s an open-and-shut case, and Texas is just the tip of the iceberg. There are many more states with the same laws, so if Trump doesn&#x2019;t win the GOP nomination, he cannot be president.<br></p><p>But there&#x2019;s one important caveat. He can still be a spoiler.</p><p>Despite having no chance to win, Trump could turn his campaign into a kamikaze-style attack just to spite Desantis and split the Republican Party&#x2019;s votes. Would it be stupid? Yes. Would it run counter to Republican goals? Yes. Would it align to Trump&#x2019;s goal of harming people he perceives to be his enemies? Yes. And that&#x2019;s why he&#x2019;ll strongly consider it.</p><p>Right now the odds are that Trump wins the Republican primary. But if he doesn&#x2019;t win, watch out. Everything we know about him tells us he won&#x2019;t go away quietly, or concede gracefully. He&#x2019;d have zero mathematical chance to win, but a nearly 100% chance to hand Desantis a loss. He might just do it.</p>",2023-03-06 21:54:05,üí¨,3244-a2fa

59,Hating the Mall Doesn‚Äôt Make You More Interesting,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/hating-the-mall-doesnt-make-you-more-interesting/,"<p>Everyone I know hates the mall, and I&#x2019;m not here to change their mind. I want to go one level higher to discuss how people bond over things they hate. And then I want to go another level higher above that to talk about &#x201C;othering.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s really easy to build a shared culture when you have a shared enemy. But is it worth it?</p><p><strong>&#x201C;Ugh, the suburbs&#x201D;</strong></p><p>I started working in tech two days after Y2K, January 3, 2000. One of my friends at work was a guy in his early 20s from the Minnesota suburbs. He was thrilled to be living in the go-go culture of urban Seattle. And he made a point to talk about hating suburbs, which I thought was odd. What&#x2019;s wrong with the suburbs, I wondered. The answer, I realised over time, is that the suburbs aren&#x2019;t fancy enough. Because that&#x2019;s where poor people live. Not that he&#x2019;d use those words outright.</p><p><strong>Olive Garden, TGI Fridays, and The Cheesecake Factory</strong></p><p>I don&#x2019;t want to be delicate and use other words like design, aesthetics, taste, or use the word &#x201C;bespoke.&#x201D; I want to be more direct and say that rich people don&#x2019;t want to admit they hate the poor, so they make fun of all the things lower-income people enjoy. Bad food, bad alcohol, bad electronics, bad movies, bad bands. Poor people are bad. They have no &#x201C;taste.&#x201D; Whereas you, by extension, must be special because you have excellent taste. But really? You just have money and like to talk about the ways in which you spend it.</p><p><strong>Enjoy what you enjoy</strong></p><p>I&#x2019;m not trying to convince anyone to try different things. Enjoy what you enjoy, whether it&#x2019;s mainstream or indie, mass-produced or bespoke, western or eastern, mall or a blindfolded dining experience at a Michelin restaurant. Knock yourselves out.</p><p>But the actual rich people I grew up with in Bethesda, Maryland (The 6th richest zip code in the country, I just learned) never made fun of poor people, even indirectly. When I was growing up, PhDs didn&#x2019;t care if you called them doctor or not. You&#x2019;d have a great conversation with your friend&#x2019;s parent, where work didn&#x2019;t come up at all, and you&#x2019;d find out later that they were a director at NIH, or the president of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. I was taught SCUBA by a guy from the CIA but I only noticed because I saw a little logo on his clothes when we were preparing to get in the pool. I didn&#x2019;t bring it up, and he didn&#x2019;t either. That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m used to experiencing. That&#x2019;s what feels right to me.</p><p><strong>What you hate is who you are, so pick carefully</strong></p><p>There are three kinds of people in this essay. First, the truly powerful who don&#x2019;t feel the need to dunk on everyone else all the time. Second, the newly or aspirationally rich who think talking about their fine taste (and how others have bad taste) is an important part of living the good life and surrounding yourself with the right people. And then there are the rest of humanity. They may be more likely to enjoy malls, or listen to top 40 music, or eat at Olive Garden. Let them. They&#x2019;re not your enemy, and shouldn&#x2019;t be exhibit A for talking about how cultured you are in comparison.</p>",2023-03-04 21:17:25,üí¨,8dc5-1ef0
64,A Dispatch from the Beach,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/a-dispatch-from-the-beach/,"<p>My family has a secluded beach that we like to visit. It&#x2019;s about an hour and a half away from our home in Wellington, New Zealand and we love it. I have spent the last few hours in the car organising my iPhone apps, and I&#x2019;m here to defend my decision.</p><p>I think people have funny ideas about how leisure time should be spent. But leisure time is extremely personal, like what sorts of books you like, or your favourite foods. Some people can relax next to a pool, some relax typing numbers in spreadsheets. Some go on safari, others play online games. It&#x2019;s important to relax, but there&#x2019;s no right or wrong way to do it.</p><p>I slept a little, I walked a little, I talked with my kids a little.

201,Broadening and narrowing,https://academia.lot23.com/post/15,"I've been analysing more research papers, and I'm starting to wonder if my topic should be pulled broader than just Explorables.<br /><br />I could imagine one approach where I explain what Explorables are and how effective they are. I'd compare how well people retain information across a series of other media types such as PDFs, YouTube videos, textbooks, then compare those results to Explorables. That could work.<br /><br />But what about flipping it around? What if instead of leading with Explorables and comparing it to other media types, I instead lead with standard topics like education, communication, and usability? Put Explorables aside for a moment. I'd love to see data proving that a PDF expresses information less well than a responsive website, or that a YouTube video is far better than a traditional textbook for certain scenarios. And in the midst of that research, sure, I'd refer to Explorables too. This is a tempting approach, because I love making design concepts as objectively true as possible. I love seeing that one button gets a 9% clickthrough rate but another button gets scores 11%, making it objectively 2% better. I'd love to explore that as part of this work.<br /><br />Then again, I am a fan of focusing. Writing a paper about a new media type is a lot easier than attempting to add to research about a giant field of study like ""communication"" or ""education.""<br /><br />To consider!<br /><br />",2023-04-29 08:51:10,üéì,409c-bd23

326,Understanding the Aftermath of New Zealand‚Äôs 2023 Election (2/2),https://jonbell.medium.com/understanding-the-aftermath-of-new-zealands-2023-election-2-2-8be7c5d01340?source=rss-15b289981db3------2,"<p>Wow! A lot of interesting things happened in the New Zealand election three weeks ago, and there are some similarities to US politics that will be fun to dive into. If you didn‚Äôt read <a href=""https://jonbell.medium.com/understanding-new-zealands-election-using-american-political-metaphors-16e8a727ae58"">part one</a>, you should start there because I wrote it before election¬†day.</p><h4>The top-line¬†summary</h4><p>The main party on the left (Labour, which are like Democrats) was in power, and the main party on the right (National, which are like Republicans) won on election night. But it wasn‚Äôt a decisive victory, which is causing all sorts of drama. Let‚Äôs dive¬†in!</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*K_QKhxxtOaF2ZOzy"" /><figcaption>Source: RNZ.co.nz (which is like New Zealand‚Äôs NPR or¬†BBC)</figcaption></figure><h4>Rating my predictions</h4><p>The left was showing a surge in the final week of the campaign, so I figured they‚Äôd do better than expected. I wasn‚Äôt alone in this sort of prediction, which is why election night was such a shock for the left and such a joy for the right. Here‚Äôs how the seats looked on election¬†night:</p><p>National: 50 (5 more than I predicted)<br>Labour: 34 (2¬†fewer)</p><p>On election night, it looked like a massacre. National did better than expected and appeared to have a mandate, and Labour did far worse and appeared to have face-planted. There were a lot of long faces on the left that night. But people started running the numbers, and something didn‚Äôt look quite¬†right‚Ä¶</p><h4>The ‚Äúred mirage‚Äù¬†effect</h4><p>In US politics, it‚Äôs common for the Republicans to do well earlier in the voting (red), but as mail-in ballots are counted, the Democratic votes (blue) often outnumber them. This leads to something we call the ‚Äúred mirage,‚Äù where early numbers are misleading and over-estimate the¬†right.</p><p>That‚Äôs what happened in New Zealand. National shot up to 41% in the early numbers, which exceeded expectations. But as the night wore on, their numbers settled back down to 38%. Those three points were enough to doom them. They still won, but on very different terms than they were hoping¬†for.</p><h4>The misleading ‚Äúmirror image‚Äù narrative</h4><p>Early in the night, when National was riding high, most pundits and online commentators were saying the election was a ‚Äúmirror image‚Äù of what happened in our previous election, 2020. But it takes some pretty tortured logic to describe it that¬†way:</p><p>2020: Labour (Democrats) got 50.01% of the popular vote, an all-time record since 1993, when New Zealand moved to this form of voting. It was such a dominant number that they didn‚Äôt even need a coalition partner to govern, <strong><em>which has never happened</em></strong>.</p><p>2023: National (Republicans) got ~38% of the popular vote, a middling number that meant they‚Äôd need to partner with an alt-right party to even come close to governing. And there was a real chance they‚Äôd also need to partner with a third party called New Zealand First, an extremist anti-immigrant party that National openly despises.</p><p>This is like comparing Usain Bolt to three kids in a trenchcoat. There may be similarities, but one wins decisively and the other can barely stand up without toppling over. Mirror image, my¬†ass.</p><h4>Three weeks to count the remaining (left-leaning) votes</h4><p>New Zealand has a slow process for counting their remaining votes, because a huge proportion of the votes come in after election day. The trouble for National is that these votes are generally understood to be left-leaning, and if they lost even a little support they‚Äôd have to partner with New Zealand First. And they desperately did not want¬†that.</p><p>Watch this clip of Luxon on election night. When he says he‚Äôll be able to lead with a party called ACT, what he‚Äôs really saying is ‚Äúyay, we performed well enough to not need to partner with New Zealand¬†First!‚Äù</p><iframe src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FfYWiIbzU7Go%3Fstart%3D115%26feature%3Doembed%26start%3D115&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DfYWiIbzU7Go&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FfYWiIbzU7Go%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""854"" height=""480"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no""><a href=""https://medium.com/media/03a469d04b96d7784e040a46abc2fbe2/href"">https://medium.com/media/03a469d04b96d7784e040a46abc2fbe2/href</a></iframe><p>And that‚Äôs why this gets him the biggest applause line of the night. Working with New Zealand First would lead to what New Zealanders are referring to a ‚Äúcoalition of chaos,‚Äù sort of like making a deal with Matt Gaetz or Rand Paul. Sort of like being Kevin McCarthy, a position no one¬†wants.</p><p>But a funny thing happened when the remaining votes came¬†in‚Ä¶</p><h4>Christopher Luxon Just Became Kevin¬†McCarthy</h4><p>The remaining votes swung left, so National didn‚Äôt just lose a single seat, which would have been a disaster for them, they ended up losing two. This means even with New Zealand First rounding out the ‚ÄúCoalition of Chaos,‚Äù the coalition only has a one seat margin of error. This is even worse than Kevin McCarthy or Mike Johnson in the US. It means that every single MP (aka congressperson) has the ability to stymie everything because they all need to vote together to proceed. That‚Äôs gonna be¬†tough.</p><p>But to be clear, the differences between parties in New Zealand versus America is hardly comparable. In America, a group of hardliners literally are trying to shut down the government. In New Zealand, they just have policy differences. So as tough as it will be, it‚Äôs not as existential of a¬†threat.</p><h4>Did the country swing right? Not¬†really</h4><p>When you have two major parties, politics is zero-sum, which makes it closer to a sport. When the Celtics win, the Lakers lose. When the Democrats win, the Republicans lose. It‚Äôs an easy mental model. But New Zealand has a coalition model, so it‚Äôs harder to work out the math to understand ‚Äúright‚Äù and ‚Äúleft.‚Äù While it‚Äôs true that the right won this election, there‚Äôs a lot of nuance in the¬†details.</p><p>In 2020, Labour gained 19 seats and National lost 23. In 2023, Labour lost 31 and National gained just 15. Where did the other votes go? Why couldn‚Äôt National even get half of the spoils from Labour‚Äôs column? Because the votes didn‚Äôt all go to the right. They actually went across the political spectrum, which dents the mandate National hoped¬†for.</p><p>On the left, The Greens and Te PƒÅti MƒÅori grabbed 9 new seats between them, both hitting all-time highs for their party. On the right, ACT and New Zealand First combined for 9 as well, but NZF is well below their all-time high, and ACT hit a new record by only adding a single seat. The reason National only took half of Labour‚Äôs seats is because a lot of Labour voters went <strong><em>further left</em></strong> than ever before. That‚Äôs fascinating.</p><p>That doesn‚Äôt take anything from National‚Äôs strong performance. They still grabbed 15 seats, so people definitely wanted change. But ‚Äúchange‚Äù wasn‚Äôt neatly defined this time around. More people than ever voted for far-left change, and a fair few (but not a record-breaking number) voted for far-right change. Meanwhile, National is content with their 48 seats, well off their all-time high of 60 seats, or the 65 Labour had 3 years¬†ago.</p><p>Think McCarthy, not¬†Pelosi.</p><h4>What now?</h4><p>Now three men with big, <a href=""https://thespinoff.co.nz/politics/25-09-2023/winston-peters-vs-david-seymour-their-15-most-venomous-insults-ranked"">fragile egos</a>, and some incompatible ideas for how to lead New Zealand, will have to get into a room and work out a deal. I have no doubt they will, and I think it‚Äôs healthy that people will have to compromise to find common ground. There are a few items where the parties are fully incompatible, but many more where they are in total agreement.</p><p>It‚Äôs too bad that the policy agreements they share happen to be things where I think they are 100% batshit crazy, but oh well. That‚Äôs democracy for you. Now it‚Äôs up to them to sell a public on their ideas, while working around the stark reality that no government since 1993 has had as fragile a mandate as them. <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/17nbub7/bumpy_roads_ahead_new_zealands_incoming_pm_set_to/"">Best of luck, mates</a>!

I want to say this other thing instead, I guess.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s ignore technological reality and feasibility for a minute and just magic wand our way into a different way of living that I fantasise about, and have for a long time: I want to filter things out.</p><p>I heard, growing up in Maryland, that there was a law against billboards. Maybe it was only the beltway, or maybe it was never true. But it stuck with me. When I drove over the Mason-Dixon Line, everything got uglier. Virginia is a beautiful state but the billboards are everywhere. Then you reach North Carolina, and it&#x2019;s the same deal. Same if you drive north, all the way from Philly to Portland. Billboards are everywhere, a part of the interstate experience. But not in Maryland. At least that&#x2019;s what I was told.</p><p>Looking at all those billboards, I wondered if there was some way to just see flowers instead. Or just a solid colour. Anything other than &#x2014; this is where I should come up with some great turn of phrase describing exactly how tacky and bad the signs are, but you know what, fuck you because I don&#x2019;t care &#x2014; anything other than that. I just wanted to wash the words away somehow. The whole thing felt rude to me.</p><p>The problem is I need that magic filter for everything, because that same ugly yelling feeling I got from the signs now seeps in from everywhere. A text from a friend, a post online, a podcast, an overheard snatch of someone&#x2019;s conversation. There&#x2019;s a level of judgement and self righteousness that&#x2019;s just everywhere, and it&#x2019;s getting worse. It&#x2019;s not just from the Trump supporters, or the crunchy vegans, or the idealistic tech folks, or the poets, or the KGATLW fans, or the screen averse or the Very Online. It&#x2019;s just humanity. All of us. We all believe in everything way the fuck too much. And we take that caring, and we fashion it into a weapon, and we attack everything that we&#x2019;ve decided is wrong.</p><p>And I&#x2019;m tired of it.</p><p>You probably want some examples. I don&#x2019;t want to share examples. But in general terms, everyone has Great Taste and is a Perfect Driver and is Really Good At Spotting Bullshit and Is Never Wrong and Knows Who the Enemy Is and Wants To Tell Me About It and I&#x2019;m done. I don&#x2019;t care. Tell it to someone else. Someone else who has space to hear it. Count me out.</p><p>Because I need less, please. So did Heather.

60,"Of Course Meta Should Get Into ActivityPub, Or: Say Hello to Techno-NIMBYs",https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/of-course-meta-should-get-into-activitypub-or-say-hello-to-techno-nimbys/,"<p>Growing up, I thought of society as split into two groups: Scrooge McDuck-level rich people and the rest of us. The rest of us were decent and just wanted a fair shake, but those stupid rich people kept messing it up for us! As I got older, I was able to loop in another stereotype: rich people don&#x2019;t care about anything except tax cuts, so they stop progress. But the rest of us care about parks, schools, the environment, and so forth, so we love progress and vote for Democrats.</p><p>Well, the Scrooge McDuck level rich people are my friends now. You can still make money as a doctor or lawyer, but the crazy rich folks these days have RSUs at FAANG companies and talk earnestly about retiring by age 30. And I used to think these people were progressive because they love gay people and switching out their avatars on social media to express solidarity with the latest cause that we&#x2019;re all doing absolutely nothing about outside our feeds. But alas. Our progressive values are too often skin deep.</p><p>I remember the first time I was surprised by a tech nerd being what I not-so-diplomatically now refer to as a &#x201C;techno-libertarian fuckwad.&#x201D; It was the year 2000, we were watching the Bush/Gore/Nader presidential returns come in, and I saw a friend of a friend say he didn&#x2019;t care who won. Wait, what? Why? Here&#x2019;s his paraphrased summary:</p><p>&#x201C;Listen, both Democrats and Republicans are coming after Microsoft, my employer. Either way they&#x2019;re coming after my livelihood, so whatever.&#x201D;</p><p>Gosh. Forget that George W Bush and the conservative agenda was like the Trump administration of that era &#x2013; anti-science, anti-progressive causes, pro-tax cuts at all costs &#x2013; the only thing this guy could think about was his RSUs and his personal wealth? How Scrooge McDuck! You don&#x2019;t get to shrug off the Bush administration&#x2019;s win and then act shocked when every cause you care about is set back a decade. But he did!</p><p>I hoped that maybe he was an anomaly. I held out hope that he was just uniquely obsessed with money, stock grants, getting promoted to the next level, all of that. I hoped that most of his co-workers could see that past a certain amount of lottery-esque wealth, it&#x2019;s obscene to claw for more. I hoped people understood that getting paid well should allow you to think bigger thoughts than your paycheck. How naive.</p><p>I went to work for the same company, Microsoft. It turns out his attitude towards wealth was pretty standard there. Then I went to work at Twitter, and holy crap. It dawned on me that when you&#x2019;re rich &#x2014; and I include myself &#x2014; many of your progressive values never make it out of #politics in Slack. We want housing to be cheaper &#x2026; until we buy a house and want the value to go up. We want black lives to matter! But &#x2026; you know, as long as my job is safe. We hated on Walmart for poor business practices! But, I mean, two day shipping from Amazon is pretty great so it&#x2019;s different.</p><p>Take every rich tech worker and ask them if they&#x2019;d do the same work for a non-profit. Some percentage of them will tell you they would, because some percentage of people will lie about anything. They&#x2019;ll spin some yarn about how they believe in &#x201C;the mission&#x201D; or whatever. Bullshit. They work at those jobs because they pay really well. And if they paid half as much, they would leave.</p><p>We, the progressive tech workers, love the idea of being altruistic. We love the idea of everyone paying their fair share. We love the idea of a better world. Just don&#x2019;t fuck with our RSUs.</p><p>I have friends who work in non-profits and they&#x2019;re like farmers listening to city slickers extoll the virtues of the simple life. Sure, it&#x2019;s all fun to talk about driving a tractor for a living if you&#x2019;re a tourist, but no one actually follows through and buys the farm. Just like how no one goes to a non-profit. It&#x2019;s too hard to make that little money.</p><p>So what does this have to do with Meta and ActivityPub? It&#x2019;s about talking big versus actually putting your skin in the game. That shift can be scary if you&#x2019;re more interested in thinking big idealistic thoughts than doing hard work that has actual tradeoffs.</p><p>ActivityPub has toiled in non-nerd obscurity for years. The thinking is that it&#x2019;s a cool concept, but too complicated, and never going to make the leap to the mainstream. Some people were more angry about it. Those SHEEPLE with their MAINSTREAM TASTES and their DUMB FACEBOOK FEEDS don&#x2019;t understand how great the fediverse could be. UGH. Morons.</p><p>Replace &#x201C;Facebook&#x201D; with &#x201C;World of Warcraft&#x201D; or &#x201C;Taylor Swift&#x201D; or &#x201C;Windows&#x201D; and instead propose &#x201C;EVE Online&#x201D;, some acid jazz indie band that only plays on Tuesdays if you know the morse code password, and some Linux distro powered by kombucha and you see the same attitude everywhere. It&#x2019;s not about taste, it&#x2019;s about caste. It&#x2019;s not saying &#x201C;this is better,&#x201D; it&#x2019;s saying &#x201C;I am better.&#x201D;</p><p>But just like when your hipster band gets big, or Apple is no longer the scrappy underdog, or SNL dares do anything after its first season, the only thing people hate more than the mainstream not &#x201C;getting it&#x201D; is when the mainstream does, in fact, get it. Because then its popularity grows, and that&#x2019;s scary when you are comfortable with the old thing.</p><p>There&#x2019;s a rumour that Meta is going to try making an ActivtyPub concept to see if it has wings. And all the techno-NIMBYs are out here like THERE GOES THE NEIGHBOURHOOD. Personally, I love the idea. If ActivtyPub is a great concept, ok, then let&#x2019;s prove it. Let&#x2019;s try it out. Let&#x2019;s see what happens.</p><p>Unless what you&#x2019;re saying is you want to <em>talk</em> about changing things but are not a fan of going much further. There&#x2019;s a word for people who get upset when new things are attempted because they lack the safety and clarity of the old things. That word is conservative. And it&#x2019;s pretty common amongst Scrooge McDuck types.</p>",2023-03-11 20:50:18,üí¨,5b70-7e78
65,Another Perspective,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/another-perspective/,"<p>Many years ago I found a website somewhere on PBS or NPR that took major issues of the day and argued both sides effectively. It was structured like a poll or a choose your own adventure, so it might say:</p><p>&#x201C;What do you think about gun control?&#x201D;</p><p>Click here if you think we need more</p><p>Click here if you think we need less</p><p>And whichever one you clicked would share some rational information about the other side of the argument. Then it would ask if you were convinced by the new information or not. If you were convinced, it would argue the other side again. If you weren&#x2019;t convinced, it would try harder. It was really interesting!</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>A few years ago, I found a website that is set up to be a virtual debate between two people. I was friends with one of the contestants, so I read through their asynchronous debate which was about gun control. My friend wants more gun control, and he was arguing against someone who had some statistics to share about guns in America. The whole site was about reasonable debate, so the discussion was very level-headed and interesting. Here&#x2019;s a general summary of how the chat went:</p><p>My friend: Guns are out of control in America</p><p>Other guy: They are, let&#x2019;s talk about how to address it</p><p>Friend: We need stricter control over guns</p><p>Guy: Did you know most gun deaths (54%) are suicides? Let&#x2019;s talk about the problem we&#x2019;re trying to solve. Fewer gun deaths, including suicide, or less violent attacks?</p><p>Friend: Both are important, but let&#x2019;s focus on violent attacks</p><p>Guy: Did you know stabbings are out of control in Britain? There are fewer guns but still a lot of violence. Higher than the US in places.</p><p>And so forth.</p><p>I enjoyed reading both experiences, but they uncover a whole new issue hiding underneath: seeing more shades of grey can be isolating and confusing. It&#x2019;s pretty easy to get super mad at write in all caps with other people who are super mad and writing in all caps. It&#x2019;s a lot harder to say &#x201C;I mostly agree with you but I think your solutions may be too black and white.&#x201D;</p><p>When we talk about privilege, we often talk about socioeconomic status, race, and gender. But over time a phrase keeps echoing in the back of my head while I do research: &#x201C;nuance is a luxury.&#x201D; Most of us don&#x2019;t have time to go beyond the oft-repeated stats about climate change, sexism, capitalism, racism, policing, big tech, and so forth. So we cling to our datapoints, write off the people clinging to different datapoints, and don&#x2019;t take the time to really learn the issues. We all think we do, just like everyone thinks they&#x2019;re an above-average driver. We all think we&#x2019;ve identified the problem, and it&#x2019;s &#x201C;them.&#x201D; Because if it was &#x201C;us&#x201D; that would just be too much to bear.</p><p>I can&#x2019;t really blame us. We&#x2019;re busy and stressed out. Diving into more nuance, and getting further from like-minded people, only adds to our stress and isolation. New perspectives are a luxury. Actually absorbing them and allowing them to change us, even in small ways, is just too heavy a lift for most of us. So we despair, surrounded by friends, from our fixed perspective.</p>",2023-02-13 20:10:24,üí¨,e010-064a

202,A wonderful summary,https://academia.lot23.com/post/14,"I've been analysing what other people have written about my chosen research topic. This has left me with a spreadsheet of one-paragraph summaries across seven different research papers. I just grabbed all seven paragraphs and asked chatGPT to find similarities across all of them, outliers, and things that aren't being addressed. 15 seconds later, I had a fantastic analysis prepared for me. Two insights come to mind: first, this is amazing. Second, I think I want to focus on things that other people haven't.<br /><br />chatGPT's full response is below:<br /><br />Across these studies, the central theme is the development and evaluation of explorable explanations and interactive content in various domains, such as education, data journalism, and scientific publishing. Most of the works aim to lower the barriers for creating explorable explanations, focusing on user-friendly tools and systems like Data Theater, Fidyll, and OOB. These tools cater to educators, domain experts, and data storytellers, emphasizing rapid prototyping and reducing programming complexity.<br /><br />Another common focus is the characterization and evaluation of explorable explanations, with Granstr√∂m's thesis and Fogh's work discussing the design process and educational aspects of these interactive experiences. Both studies emphasize the importance of considering the target audience and their background knowledge when designing explorable explanations.<br /><br />Several works, such as the Parametric Press, emphasize the potential of modern tools for dynamic publishing, aiming to expand the reach of interactive writing and data-driven storytelling beyond specialized domains. Meanwhile, the explorable multiverse analysis report uniquely addresses the replication crisis in research by combining multiverse analysis and explorable explanations to increase research paper transparency.<br /><br />As an outlier, the OOB mobile app specifically targets students struggling with traditional learning methods in Brazil, aiming to promote diverse teaching methodologies within the Brazilian community. Overall, there seems to be limited discussion on the scalability of these tools and systems, potential cultural differences, and how to make these explorable explanations more accessible and inclusive to broader audiences.<br /><br />",2023-04-28 08:59:11,üéì,04db-f7d3
214,Memoir story #1,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/memoir-story-1/,"<p>Today I was talking to my friend about memoirs and we talked about how magical their stories can be. You don&#x2019;t have be famous, or smart, or interesting. You just have to honestly explain what happened. If I can read your story and understand a little bit about how it might have felt to be you, it&#x2019;s successful.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve worked up a few projects in the past that are memoir-like, but I&#x2019;ve never wanted to write a linear one. I don&#x2019;t think most people care about where my ancestors came from, or the exact hospital where I was born, stuff like that. That&#x2019;s one of the beautiful things about a memoir: you&#x2019;re communicating not just through your stories, but through what you chose to put in, plus the order you decide. Bob Dylan&#x2019;s scattershot biography is a great example of this. He purposely didn&#x2019;t talk about the significant years, and went deep on the background details of the albums that no one liked. That, in itself, is a choice that tells a powerful story.</p><p>So today I wondered what my first story would be. Would I choose my first memory? Maybe a story about how I was as a baby? Would I dive straight into a story from my adult life in order to frame things up?</p><p>Wait, I&#x2019;ve got it. I have two stories that make one, and it&#x2019;s my memoir story #1.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>I knew it was coming. I was instructed to lie down for a spanking. If it was like every other time, one of my parents would cooly yank down my standard red shorts and my underwear around my bottom and smack me hard. Probably 5 or 10 swats each time. I remember writhing around, hot tears, and the awkwardness of my parents finishing and trying to make small talk afterwards. I&#x2019;d usually just stay in my room sobbing while they ducked silently out of the room.</p><p>My parents are logical and smart. There was rarely a sense of them being out-of-control or angry during these sessions. Theirs was more of a paint-by-numbers approach, and the steely determination of two straight-A nerds trying to faithfully follow IKEA furniture instructions. That was the logical way they parented: when your dog is sick, you go to the vet. When you need to change a flat tire, you first get a jack. And when your child is out of control, you discipline them with spankings. Because this is what the books say to do. This is how you fix your child. Everything logical. Everything in its right place. Crying alone.</p><p>No one could understand what my problem was. I was impulsive. I was high energy. Everything felt so big, all of the time, so I cried a lot to relieve the crushing pressure on my mind. I often yelled at the teacher in frustration, which meant I was in the principal&#x2019;s office nearly every day. I got used to the pitying way the other kids looked at me. I realised I was the problem child. At the same time, I could be charming, and there was something charismatic about a bad kid. I did make a few friends here and there despite it all.</p><p>I met my first real friend when I was 5. My family was new in town, so his parents must have invited us over to teach us the ropes of suburban Maryland. It only took about three minutes to drive to their house, because he was just down the street from the elementary school I walked to every morning. After going to his house a few times, he cornered me in his room and made me do sexual things against my will. It became prerequisite for playing. Before we could do something I wanted to do, we needed to go into his closet and fool around. I think it happened 2 or 3 times. I hated it, but I didn&#x2019;t have other friends. Eventually it stopped. I forget how or why.</p><p>That was how my life felt in those early years. I was too much to handle, which got me in trouble at home and at school, and I hated being alone with my first friend. But all of that is just a background for my memoir story number one. On this day, it was my dad. And on this day he grabbed a leather belt, which was becoming more common. And on this day, I decided I wouldn&#x2019;t cry. I refused to give him the satisfaction, and as I prepared for the challenge I felt a flush of satisfaction of setting an audacious goal I wasn&#x2019;t sure I could reach.</p><p>It worked. As my dad hit me over and over, I felt myself go completely limp and inert. I didn&#x2019;t even moan or sniffle, instead I just waited for him to be done. The pain no longer mattered, because I had won. My mind had found a safer harbour at last. By playing dead, I was born into who I was meant to be.</p><p>Years later, my dad told a family friend about how he experienced the beating. He said my stillness &#x201C;scared him,&#x201D; and I immediately spat out a mental retort, not daring to say it out loud: &#x201C;Good.&#x201D; I was proud of five year old me for finding my own way to fight back against Goliath. I don&#x2019;t remember the sting of that whipping. But his mind had been sharpened that day. He&#x2019;d never forget when his kid made him feel powerless. And that&#x2019;s good.</p><p>The balance of power has never shifted back.</p>",2023-05-12 05:32:37,üí¨,2ef7-ad76
252,Reverse,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/reverse/,"<p>Cargo Cult Science is a helpful term for describing people going
through all the actions without understanding root causes. I sometimes
use the term &quot;cargo cult design&quot; to explain imitating UX or
product ideas without knowing why.</p><p>A lifetime ago,
&quot;netbooks&quot; were cheap laptops that were small, underpowered,
and could do basic internet tasks. People said Apple was missing the
netbook party for years. Their laptops weren&apos;t cheap or targeted to
mobile scenarios, so the conventional wisdom was that they&apos;d lose
the next generation of computing. This era inspired Chromebooks, and
Google has done quite well with them.</p><p>You know what else did well
(better, in fact)? &#xA0;Apple&apos;s answer to a cheaper, more limited,
internet computer, which they called iPad. Apple didn&apos;t agree they
needed to strip down macOS, use low quality parts, and go head-to-head
with conventional wisdom for netbooks. They went for &quot;cheaper than
a laptop and focused on mobile computing,&quot; and now we don&apos;t
talk much about netbooks anymore. But we sure talk about
iPad.</p><p>Same with HomePods. Everyone thought Apple needed apps on
their voice assistant, like Alexa. Eveyone thought audio quality would
be an afterthought, because customers would be so in love with their
audio assistant they wouldn&apos;t mind poor quality speakers that
listened to us in our homes. Apple did the reverse, by focusing on sound
quality and letting Siri be as disappointing and limited as ever. Apple
made some very nice speakers and the Alexa division recently lost $10
billion in one year.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg recently said Apple Vision
demos didn&apos;t look like a future he wants to see, because they all
feature a person sitting alone on a couch. Fair point, one that I think
a lot of people agree with. He stressed that Facebook&apos;s vision is
about bringing people closer together, which sounds good. But let&apos;s
analyse further, because &quot;social&quot; can mean a lot of things.*
It can mean closer to a few people emotionally or in the same physical
location as a stadium-sized crowd of humanity, which are very different
experiences.</p><p>What&apos;s better for society and mental health,
looking through your own photos or yelling at people on Twitter?
What&apos;s more engaging and nourishing, playing a single player game
with a great story or dealing with griefers in a MMORPG? A group chat of
friends or 4Chan? DMs on Instagram or watching a celebrity get ratioed
on the public feed? Is it easier to be in the moment while meditating
quietly to yourself, or in a tourist spot in Times Square?</p><p>I hear,
understand, and relate to the point of view that technology needs to
help bring people closer together. In my view, and experience working at
Twitter, doing that at massive scale can dehumanise us and commoditise
our interactions. It&apos;s like a busy amusement park. Sure, you see
lots of people around you, but that doesn&apos;t mean you feel close to
them, or any less lonely. On the other hand, a deep conversation with a
family member or spouse, especially if you&apos;re far away, and
especially if you can see their face, can be very meaningful.</p><p>
Bringing people together can mean two things. It can mean a large volume
of strangers, where the metaverse is Facebook with avatars and
there&apos;s a lot of social mixing with strangers. Like going to
Disneyland alone, or VR Chat, which in my experience feels like Reddit
multiplied by a Gathering of the Juggalos. But &quot;bringing people
together&quot; can also mean your close circle of friends communicating
throughout the day with iMessage and Facetime. (Or Marco Polo, an app I
love) Or maybe watching a movie together, via SharePlay.</p><p>I think
this is going to go the way of Netbooks and HomePods. I think Apple has
identified that &quot;social media&quot; is a sliver of your day, and a
stressful one at that. Whereas they believe personal productivity and
keeping in touch with close friends is much more important scenario to
optimise for. I agree with them.</p><hr><p>*iPod came out in 2001 with
good sound quality and a music store. Microsoft&apos;s Zune came out
five years later with the marketing slogan &quot;Welcome to the
Social.&quot; <a
href=""https://news.microsoft.com/2006/11/13/welcome-to-the-social/?ref=a
-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io"">The announcement</a> from 2006 played up
a feature that let you find another person with a Zune, send them a
song, then they can listen to the song 3 times over 3 days, with an
option to buy it from the Zune store. CEO Ballmer infamously described
it like this:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;The value of Zune, if we&#x2019;re
successful, is all in the software. It&#x2019;s in community. I want to
squirt you a picture of my kids. You want to squirt me back a video of
your vacation.&#x201D;</blockquote><p>When Steve Jobs was asked about
the Zune and its marquee technology, he had a <a
href=""https://signalvnoise.com/posts/52-steve-jobs-just-put-it-in-her-
ear?ref=a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io"">great response</a> to this
question: &quot;[Zune] says that this device is all about building
communities. Are you worried?&quot;</p><blockquote>In a word, no.
I&#x2019;ve seen the demonstrations on the Internet about how you can
find another person using a Zune and give them a song they can play
three times. It takes forever. By the time you&#x2019;ve gone through
all that, the girl&#x2019;s got up and left! <em>You&#x2019;re much
better off to take one of your earbuds out and put it in her ear. Then
you&#x2019;re connected with about two feet of headphone
cable.</em></blockquote><p>Microsoft described a &quot;social&quot; that
was fiddly, slow, nerdy, tied to DRM, encouraged interacting with people
in public, and helpfully upsold you to a store at the end. Apple just
focused on a great music listening experience and stopped there. Worth
noting.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>",2023-06-09 20:17:47,üí¨,f0fd-8c5b

For example, maybe the last shows were played in San Diego, Los Angeles, Sacramento, Oakland, and San Franciso, which means we‚Äôre moving¬†north.</li><li>Find an API that lets me enter a city name and find another city name within x miles. Ideally I can point the direction north so the next show ends up in Portland rather than back down to Santa¬†Cruz.</li><li>The distance shouldn‚Äôt be standardised. After going to Seattle and Vancouver, it‚Äôs common for bands to fly over to the east coast and start the next leg of the tour there. So ‚Äúfind a show within X miles of the previous show‚Äù is too limiting. You also need some concept of appropriate times to fly to a new¬†section.</li></ol><p>Frankly, this code is too finicky and boring for me to spend time on. I‚Äôm not interested in writing a bespoke algorithm for touring, so I‚Äôd just continue writing the tour schedule by hand because there‚Äôs no other way worth my¬†time.</p><p>But now now that I have chatGPT, figuring out the next step on the tour has turned into a one step¬†process:</p><ol><li>Tell chatGPT ‚ÄúYou are planning a tour across the world. Shows usually happen in bigger cities, and if the cities are big enough, you can play 2 or even 3 nights in a single location. The previous five shows before this one have been San Diego, Los Angeles, Sacramento, Oakland, and San Franciso. What should the next show location be?‚Äù and get Portland, Oregon.</li></ol><p>Think about how much that will change how we write software. Instead of hand-editing an algorithm from scratch, inevitably finding edgecases that don‚Äôt make sense, and having to maintain the code forever, we can just ask AI to provide the algorithm in a single call. This is a big deal with enormous implications.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_R7WUlJids8n7NUhcIqzwQ.png"" /></figure><p>For what it‚Äôs worth, here are the next 25 shows on the tour, with ample space for traveling between each¬†city:</p><ol><li>Portland, Oregon,¬†USA</li><li>(1 rest¬†day)</li><li>Seattle, Washington, USA</li><li>(1 rest¬†day)</li><li>Vancouver, Canada</li><li>Vancouver, Canada (Second¬†night)</li><li>(1 rest¬†day)</li><li>Calgary, Canada</li><li>(2 rest¬†days)</li><li>Edmonton, Canada</li><li>(1 rest¬†day)</li><li>Winnipeg, Canada</li><li>(2 rest¬†days)</li><li>Minneapolis, USA</li><li>(1 rest¬†day)</li><li>Chicago, USA</li><li>Chicago, USA (Second¬†night)</li><li>(1 rest¬†day)</li><li>Detroit, USA</li><li>(1 rest¬†day)</li><li>Toronto, Canada</li><li>Toronto, Canada (Second¬†night)</li><li>(2 rest¬†days)</li><li>Montreal, Canada</li><li>(1 rest¬†day)</li><li>Boston, USA</li><li>(1 rest¬†day)</li><li>New York,¬†USA</li><li>New York, USA (Second¬†night)</li><li>(1 rest¬†day)</li><li>Philadelphia, USA</li><li>(1 rest¬†day)</li><li>Washington, DC,¬†USA</li><li>(2 rest¬†days)</li><li>Atlanta, USA</li><li>(1 rest¬†day)</li><li>Miami, USA</li><li>(1 rest¬†day)</li><li>New Orleans,¬†USA</li><li>(1 rest¬†day)</li><li>Houston, USA</li><li>(1 rest¬†day)</li><li>Dallas, USA</li><li>(1 rest¬†day)</li><li>Austin, USA</li></ol><p>See you on the (made up)¬†road!</p><img src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=adfb2ab90dc1"" width=""1"" height=""1"" alt="""">",2023-08-13 08:16:18,üìù,d0be-61b9
310,Twitter had the right policy,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/twitter-had-the-right-policy/,"<p>I was at Twitter and trying to influence policy in 2016, when Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton and became president of the United States of America. I saw a lot of complaints and concerns aimed at Twitter, many totally reasonable, and quite a few that I agreed with personally. But I could never quite get my head around the idea that Trump should be kicked off the platform. It never made sense to me, other than through a reactionary and emotional lens.</p><p>When the President of the United States says something, it is news. They can issue press releases, they can speak to reporters, they can send White House employees to speak off record, and so forth. And part of controlling the biggest military in the world is that your words will sometimes carry a threat of violence. When George W Bush said the 9/11 planners would &#x201C;hear from us soon,&#x201D; that was a threat of violence. Speak softly and carry a big stick was too. Any time someone says &#x201C;this aggression will not stand,&#x201D; or even argues for sanctions, those are all sabre-rattling phrases. It&#x2019;s all fair game. And yet when the broadcast mechanism became Twitter, people &#x2013; many of whom are personal friends of mine &#x2013; lost historical perspective and decided it was against the rules of Twitter and should therefore be banned. I never agreed with that.</p><p>Trump should always have been able to say that North Korea would suffer catastrophic consequences if they threatened South Korea, as childish and dangerous as his tweets were. One tweet read &#x201C;Will someone from [Kim&#x2019;s] depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger &amp; more powerful one than his, and my Button works!&quot; which caused a total meltdown on the left. Other than the existential dread, which didn&#x2019;t help anyone see things clearly, there was a feeling that he clearly broke the rules and if Twitter didn&#x2019;t take action they were clearly acting out of financial interest. Trump brings clicks, so let&#x2019;s let him destroy the whole world, is the grand total of that conspiracy theory. It&#x2019;s not a well-reasoned argument.</p><p>Imagine if Donald Trump spoke to a reporter for NBC News, who then bleeped out his response, saying it was against NBC News policy. Or if the Washington Post said they heard Trump say something about North Korea but weren&#x2019;t going to report it because of concerns that it might cause a war. The country, and the world at large, would be flabbergasted by those decisions, because it&#x2019;s not the job of the free press to decide what a world leader is or isn&#x2019;t supposed to be saying while acting as the leader of a nation. It&#x2019;s not their job. At all.</p><p>&#x201C;So what you&#x2019;re saying is there are different rules for me versus the President of the United States when discussing war, threats of violence, and statecraft?&#x201D; Yes, and if this is the first time this has dawned on you, then good luck in the real world, buddy. A man yelling &#x201C;I am going to kill North Korea!&#x201D; from his bedroom window is just categorically different than a world leader declaring the same thing. Is this surprising to anyone? Do I need to draw a map? Here, I&#x2019;ll convert it to Star Wars for you. Remember when Yoda said with great power comes great responsibility? That applies to both Trump and Twitter in this case. Trump can indeed say things that normal civilians can&#x2019;t. And Twitter does, in fact, need to treat the words of world leaders differently than you or me. Sorry to burst your bubble, I guess? But this isn&#x2019;t rocket science.</p><p>(As an aside, this is why the &#x201C;misleading tweet&#x201D; label was invented. The idea was &#x201C;let the crap stay up, but with editorial commentary.&#x201D; That sidesteps the censorship angle while trying to address misinformation. As a second aside, I 100% agreed that when Trump attempted a coup against the United States of America, <em>that</em> was not protected speech. Twitter did the right thing when they banned Trump that time. As did Facebook and YouTube.)</p><p>This whole debate came back to me today because now there&#x2019;s evidence that Trump was using his Twitter DMs to communicate illegal activities. For a guy who famously tried to destroy evidence (ripping up papers and flushing them down the toilet, for example) it&#x2019;s surprising that he forgot that Twitter DMs aren&#x2019;t secure. But let&#x2019;s be clear about what this development means: Trump&#x2019;s use of Twitter may actually be part of the evidence that leads to his downfall. If he had never used Twitter, there still would have been a January 6th. There still would have been threats against other countries and erratic, to say the least, leadership for those four horrible years. Things would have been largely the same from an outcomes standpoint.</p><p>But we wouldn&#x2019;t have had all this juicy evidence to help convict him. Twitter did the right thing, both from a policy standpoint and also from a double-bank-shot long shot accidental strategy sense. In the history books, Twitter will be part of Trump downfall. And that&#x2019;s pretty sweet.</p>",2023-08-16 22:07:23,üí¨,d6d0-36d6

334,A plate of beans,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/a-plate-of-beans/,"<p>There&#x2019;s an ancient internet forum for nerds where someone once joked that its members could overanalyse a plate of beans. This understandably led to a lot of jokes where people tried to actually analyse the plate of beans.</p><p>Metaphors are funny that way. Take any concept and object and you can find a path between them. The US economy is like, for example, a hot air balloon. Why? Because it doesn&#x2019;t take a direct form. You can try to influence whether it goes up or down, but there are a ton of factors outside of direct control. And even then, the results can be on a delay. See? Easy. Metaphors are closer to dad joke puns than any deep well of wisdom and insight.</p><p>I was attacked by an unleashed pit bull in my neighbourhood a few months ago. It locked its massive steel trap jaws around the bottom half of my small dog, and tried to violently rip her in half. It&#x2019;s a few months later now, and we&#x2019;re both fine. My dog made a full recovery after emergency surgery, I made a full recovery after a night in the hospital, and the owner of the dog paid the vet bills and apologised. We&#x2019;re ok. As ok as we can be.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t usually use screen protectors on my phones. In my family, it&#x2019;s a given that a new phone means a new screen protector and case. I always use a case, but only sporadically go through the effort of lining up a new screen protector. It&#x2019;s worked pretty well for me over the years. I&#x2019;ve shattered one screen that I can remember, and I&#x2019;m sure I&#x2019;ve had chips and dings, but nothing too bad. When the pit bull attacked, my phone went flying, but there wasn&#x2019;t any damage.</p><p>Post traumatic stress is hard to predict, and I knew that from day one. I knew after a week that we&#x2019;d be ok physically, but I also knew that the stress of the experience might return in unexpected ways. Maybe I&#x2019;d have a too-large reaction to something seemingly minor, even months down the line. Maybe I&#x2019;d start panicking for no reason at the dog park. In the aftermath, I resolved to feel grateful that the attack wasn&#x2019;t worse but also keep an eye on my mental health. And to give myself grace and space if the trauma did reemerge later on.</p><p>My dog has been brave. She did fine at the dog park, she still loves other dogs, especially big ones. She&#x2019;s still perky and happy and the same dog we all love. But a few weeks ago, someone made a loud noise getting out of their car, and my poor dog jumped out of her skin. More recently, a leaf landed on her foot and it shocked and scared her. So she&#x2019;s definitely working through some anxiety after the experience. But we&#x2019;re fine. Mostly.</p><p>A few days ago, a massive dog who lives a few doors down broke out of their front yard and ran straight at us. I cried out as it happened, and desperately did my best to scoop my fox-sized dog into my arms to protect her in a way I didn&#x2019;t with the pit bull. In the excitement, my phone clattered to a rest on the pavement a few steps away. The owner of the dog asked if we were ok. &#x201C;Yup, no worries!&#x201D; I chirped, grabbed my phone, and speed-walked away.</p><p>My iPhone screen has a fracture on the edge. It doesn&#x2019;t get in the way of anything, and the six thin lines emerging from the point of impact aren&#x2019;t significant enough to cut my finger or affect the daily use. It&#x2019;s an annoyance, and a reminder. It&#x2019;s a small thing caused by a big thing. It&#x2019;s not a big deal, but it&#x2019;s not nothing. It&#x2019;s something I&#x2019;d like to forget, but it&#x2019;s a part of me now. Just a thing that happened to me once.</p>",2023-11-11 20:17:16,üí¨,3557-2921

55,How We Designed Our Focus Mode,https://medium.com/replay-io/how-we-designed-our-focus-mode-595711802998?source=rss-15b289981db3------2,"<h4>A peek into the design of our latest¬†feature</h4><p><a href=""http://replay.io"">Replay</a> records software so you can play it back later, which means you spend a lot of time navigating video through a timeline. But as we‚Äôve learned from YouTube, it can be hard finding one key moment in a long video. For example, here‚Äôs <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53dikqNZLgA&amp;t=3379s"">David Byrne dancing with a lamp</a> during the best concert film of all time. I focused the share link there so you don‚Äôt need to hunt through nearly two hours of rad early-80s content to find it. You‚Äôre¬†welcome!</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QWDPKCk7JQLt6_2OmoBDjQ.png"" /><figcaption>The Replay UI (dark theme is coming soon,¬†shh!)</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>The problem we set out to¬†solve</strong></h4><p>Watching vintage YouTube concert videos is one thing, but what about navigating through software? Any developer will tell you that debugging too often feels like finding a needle in a haystack and the haystack is on fire and you‚Äôre on fire and everything is on fire because you‚Äôre in hell. So we‚Äôve been working on the technology to focus replays to a window of time to help make life easier. We call it Focus¬†Mode.</p><h4>The goal is ‚Äúof¬†course‚Äù</h4><p>There are a lot of technical details and considerations listed below, but our end goal is always ‚Äúof course.‚Äù The end-user shouldn‚Äôt marvel at all the complexity because they shouldn‚Äôt notice it. Like a well-done soundtrack, this UX should do its dang job without drawing attention to¬†itself.</p><p>But that doesn‚Äôt mean it was easy! Here are the details we worked through on our journey to an ‚Äúof course‚Äù¬†design.</p><h4>1. Here‚Äôs our standard timeline in light¬†theme</h4><p>We start with a pretty standard pattern. The only tricky part is the slightly darker grey that shows how far we‚Äôve buffered. YouTube does this¬†too.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*B-BLZrw4s4_f4inLLNdyDA.png"" /></figure><h4>2. Unloaded¬†states</h4><p>Our first curveball! In some rare cases, a video might be so long that we need to unload portions of it. How can we show a user that the video is available but telegraph that there could be a delay? (#jealous that YouTube doesn‚Äôt have to deal with this) Here‚Äôs what we came up with‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa dotted¬†line:</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*H8FKkHkNOWBzBSKxAB7oAg.png"" /></figure><p>An important nuance to understand is that this is <em>not something the user opts into. </em>It‚Äôs something that happens to them sometimes, like an error page. So it‚Äôs important to handle it carefully. We don‚Äôt want to over-message it with annoying dialogs, but we don‚Äôt want to under-message it and cause confusion if things take a while to load. I‚Äôm skipping over lots of details, but we fussed over this and found a good¬†balance.</p><h4>3. Setting a focus¬†window</h4><p>This is where things get spicy, so we message it with an instructional prompt (not shown) and keep the wayfinding strong by keeping the interface the same with one important detail: we overlay a new focus component with draggable edges.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*podYSqbiVgHrQH6F-QzcoA.png"" /></figure><p>This is a whole new design pattern to figure out, so even though this is an opt-in professional-grade feature, we need to take care to make things as clear as possible. It‚Äôs getting tough, though! To use a juggling metaphor, we‚Äôve gone from handling three oranges of complexity to seven grapefruits. But at least we‚Äôre not juggling metaphorical UX¬†swords.</p><p>Yet.</p><h4>4. Shrinking the focus¬†window</h4><p>I love this screen, because it‚Äôs designed to feel obvious even though there‚Äôs a ton going on behind the scenes. Soak it in and I‚Äôll explain why it‚Äôs¬†cool.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GAc2dH0xFsPSWIPff0LUkw.png"" /></figure><p>Do you see how we‚Äôre re-using the blue dotted line on the left? We‚Äôre pulling a fast one here because we‚Äôre re-using the visual language in two different contexts. Oo,¬†sneaky.</p><p>We considered using different visuals for ‚Äúthings that unloaded because of user action‚Äù and ‚Äúthings that unloaded because of something behind-the-scenes‚Äù but why bother? All the user needs to know is ‚Äúdotted line means it‚Äôs not available.‚Äù</p><p>Mental models are important to get right, and sometimes it means fudging some of the pedantic ‚Äúwell actually‚Äù backend details to keep things clear and focused on the end goal. (Classic <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/job-to-be-done-to-understand-customer-personas-better-3963eff273f8"">JTBD</a> amirite) That‚Äôs what we did here, but if you blink you‚Äôll miss it. I love UX details like¬†that.</p><h4>4. ‚ÄúFocus mode,¬†engage!‚Äù</h4><p>In this view, the user is done focusing and wants to get back to the work of debugging. They‚Äôre returned to the same timeline they‚Äôre used to seeing, but now the details outside the focus area are faded back significantly.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OPpqCA2044qd-iFfHdVP-w.png"" /></figure><p>At this point, you can‚Äôt access anything outside of Focus Mode. We supress console evals, ignore events, stop the video playback, and do a lot of other housekeeping and due dilligence to make sure everything feels right. (We had a version where you could play video even when it‚Äôs outside the focus window, but it felt broken in testing. Fixed!¬†Onward!)</p><p>So is that it? Well, no. Much like a Stephen King baddie who always staggers back even when you thought he was defeated, we realised late in our process there was another edgecase we needed to solve for. What happens when you expand the focus window? How do you show the resulting loading¬†states?</p><p>Hang onto your hats,¬†y‚Äôall.</p><h4>5. OMG WTF¬†BBQ</h4><p>Looking at this visual, you‚Äôd be excused for thinking we‚Äôre not very good at this whole product design thing. But bear with me, there‚Äôs some brilliant work going on here, even though I accept that it looks overly complicated and designed by a stupid person. Hang¬†tight.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Nvze3IShz7IvnqvEkARVGw.png"" /></figure><ul><li>1 and 7 will never load because they‚Äôre outside the focus¬†window</li><li>2 will load, but it‚Äôs gonna take a second, hold your horses¬†pls</li><li>3 is hot to trot, gosh I‚Äôm really going for a horse theme¬†here</li><li>4 is our standard buffered view, so if you hit play, this area will¬†work</li><li>5 is a cousin to 2, it‚Äôll be ready¬†soon</li><li>6 is a lot like 5, but we need it to look different because it was previously outside the focus window, and that‚Äôs important info, can ya dig¬†it?</li></ul><p>So yeah. There‚Äôs a lot going on there. But remove any one of those styles and something else in the UX suffers. For example, we could make 5, 2, and 6 look the same, but then we lose context when resizing.</p><p>But it‚Äôs ok little chickens, all the complexity goes away once everything is loaded down there on screen #7. But first we need to handle some more loading¬†states.</p><h4>6. Re-hydrating our focus¬†mode</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3xBTbDa70PdvpZ-0so-KDA.png"" /></figure><p>This is an interesting view because we‚Äôre showing a loading state in two different ways. If I were in a design critique, my fellow designers would challenge this and ask if there‚Äôs a way to use the same visual language for both. It‚Äôs a good question! We worked through it, and the answer we came to was a resounding ‚Äúnope!‚Äù Not without making some design trade-offs that cause other issues, similar to the ones described above.</p><p>But of course this is a short-term state. Our servers load things pretty fast, which brings us back¬†to‚Ä¶</p><h4>7. Done¬†loading</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sSpMSk4nt_-q4k82iSFXgw.png"" /></figure><p>And here‚Äôs our standard focused state. Pretty clear, despite all the crazy contortions we had to do in the code to get here. Then when you stop needing focus mode, you can go back to the standard timeline. Voila!</p><h4>Baby steps</h4><p>This is a brand-new bouncing baby feature. Just like a real-life human baby, it‚Äôs cute and simple but now it‚Äôs up to us to make sure it grows up to be awesome. There are going to be lots of twists and turns along the way, and that‚Äôs the fun part. Let us know if you have any feedback by <a href=""http://replay.io/discord"">joining our Discord</a>.

61,"Captain Obvious, Scratch That, Professor Obvious Gets An Idea",https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/captain-obvious-scratch-that-professor-obvious-gets-an-idea/,"<p>My favourite three things in the world are &#x2014; you know, beyond all the obvious things, my family, world peace, my health, a really great grilled cheese sandwich, blah blah blah &#x2014; writing, teaching, and learning. By a long shot.</p><p>Now, I understand that those three words are pretty common, so I should probably qualify them a bit. Tons of people love writing, or at least the idea of writing. Or at least the idea of having a fully published book on the New York Times bestseller list. But what percentage of those people have actually written a book? Or keep up a daily writing practice? Or genuinely <em>enjoy</em> themselves in the process of writing? Beats me. But I&#x2019;m in that subset. And that matters.</p><p>Some people are naturally fast, so perhaps they become athletes. Some people are drawn to music, so maybe they become musicians. And some people don&#x2019;t just write because they enjoy it. They write because they don&#x2019;t enjoy life without it. Think of someone like Steven King who seemingly <em>cannot not</em> write. I may not be blessed with Steven King&#x2019;s ability to tell stories, but I am definitely blessed with his drive to keep trying.</p><p>I once read an entire book of Ernest Hemingway correspondence and came away unimpressed with who he was as a man. He has a lot of entertaining quotes and opinions, but when he says &#x201C;There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed,&#x201D; my chuckle is sad. Hey man, maybe you shouldn&#x2019;t have been a writer, then? Maybe you wouldn&#x2019;t have been as miserable? Also, maybe drink less? Just a thought. But it&#x2019;s important to stress that I do not bleed at my typewriter. I bleed when forced away from it.</p><p>Next up, teaching. I was meant to be a teacher. I have taught many classes. I have given many talks. I am smitten with it. I won&#x2019;t bore you with all the words up above, but it&#x2019;s a similar story. I <em>need</em> to teach. If I don&#x2019;t get to learn a new thing and then share it with others, I feel adrift. Also, and I wouldn&#x2019;t necessarily say this about my writing skills, I am a fantastic teacher. I love it <em>and</em> I&#x2019;m good. That&#x2019;s a pretty great combination, according to my students.</p><p>So I had a really obvious thought yesterday, after mulling it for about a decade. I should become a professor. In that job, I would be expected to learn things, write about them, teach them, and repeat. Which could not be more suited to where my interests lie today and as long as I can remember.</p><p>I met with a friend who works at the University. They explained how it all works. I volunteered my time as a guest lecturer. My first attempt is in two weeks. It&#x2019;s very clear that I was meant to do this. I cannot wait.</p>",2023-03-02 07:36:26,üí¨,d642-c887
66,The Many-worlds Interpretation is Hard to Swallow,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/the-many-worlds-interpretation-is-hard-to-swallow/,"<p>Me: Hello! I want to talk about the many-worlds interpretation today. I am having a tough time understanding why it could possibly be true.</p><p>AI: The many-worlds interpretation is a controversial interpretation of quantum mechanics that suggests the universe splits into multiple parallel universes, each corresponding to a different outcome of a quantum measurement. While it is a valid interpretation, it is still a matter of debate among physicists and philosophers. Many people find it difficult to accept because it violates our everyday intuition and common sense, but it is important to remember that quantum mechanics often defies our classical understanding of reality. Ultimately, whether or not one accepts the many-worlds interpretation is a matter of personal interpretation and perspective.</p><figure class=""kg-card kg-image-card""><img src=""https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/content/images/2023/02/JonBell_many_worlds_interpretation_beautiful_starry_everything__bb7d0b14-7313-4bac-b628-2f5934a20ae3.png"" class=""kg-image"" alt loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""1024"" srcset=""https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/02/JonBell_many_worlds_interpretation_beautiful_starry_everything__bb7d0b14-7313-4bac-b628-2f5934a20ae3.png 600w, https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/02/JonBell_many_worlds_interpretation_beautiful_starry_everything__bb7d0b14-7313-4bac-b628-2f5934a20ae3.png 1000w, https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/content/images/2023/02/JonBell_many_worlds_interpretation_beautiful_starry_everything__bb7d0b14-7313-4bac-b628-2f5934a20ae3.png 1024w"" sizes=""(min-width: 720px) 720px""></figure><p>Me: What is the best argument against many-worlds? I understand it&apos;s not falsifiable, and I understand it&apos;s not intuitive. But what are the best arguments against it other than that? Is this where Copenhagen comes in?</p><p>AI: One argument against the many-worlds interpretation is that it is not able to provide a satisfactory explanation for the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. While the many-worlds interpretation can explain the collapse of the wave function as a result of branching into parallel universes, it doesn&apos;t explain why the probabilities of certain outcomes occur in the first place. In contrast, the Copenhagen interpretation, which is the most widely accepted interpretation of quantum mechanics, explains this through the concept of wave function collapse and the role of measurement in determining the outcome of a quantum experiment. Another argument against the many-worlds interpretation is that it can be seen as adding unnecessary complexity to our understanding of the world, as it posits the existence of an infinite number of parallel universes. Some physicists and philosophers argue that it is more elegant to have a simpler, more parsimonious theory that can still account for the observed phenomena. However, it is worth noting that the concept of Occam&apos;s Razor (which favors simpler theories) is not always applicable in physics, where the most accurate theory is not necessarily the simplest one.</p><p>Me: Explain the collapse of the wave function in a way that a non-scientist can understand</p><p>AI: The wave function is a mathematical description of a particle in quantum mechanics that gives the probabilities of finding the particle in different states. When a particle is observed, the wave function collapses, meaning that the particle takes on a definite state that can be observed.</p><p>One way to understand this is to think of the wave function as a cloud that represents all the possible locations the particle could be in. Before observation, the particle is in a superposition of states, meaning that it exists in all of these possible locations at once. But when we make a measurement, we are essentially &quot;looking&quot; at the particle, which forces it to take on a definite position. This is like shining a flashlight on the cloud, causing it to condense and take on a particular shape.</p><p>The collapse of the wave function is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics that can be difficult to understand, but it is important for explaining the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics and how measurement affects the behavior of particles.</p><p>Me: And this is where schrodinger&apos;s cat comes in, eh?</p><p>If taking a measurement causes a particle to snap into one reality or another, how do we know there&apos;s no measurement before then? Isn&apos;t that a measurement in its own right?</p><p>AI: Yes, the famous thought experiment of Schr&#xF6;dinger&apos;s cat is often used to illustrate the concept of wave function collapse.</p><p>In the experiment, a cat is placed in a sealed box with a vial of poison that will be released if a radioactive particle decays. According to quantum mechanics, the particle is in a superposition of states, both decayed and not decayed, until it is observed. Therefore, until the box is opened and the particle is observed, the cat is in a superposition of states, both alive and dead.</p><p>The paradox highlights the question of when exactly the wave function collapses and whether an observer is required for this collapse to occur. The many-worlds interpretation would suggest that the wave function collapse occurs when the particle interacts with its environment, even if no conscious observer is present. However, the Copenhagen interpretation holds that a conscious observer is required to cause the collapse of the wave function.</p><p>To address your question, even though the exact moment when the wave function collapses is not well understood, it is generally believed that any interaction with the environment can cause the collapse, not just conscious measurement. In the case of Schr&#xF6;dinger&apos;s cat, the interaction of the particle with the environment (which includes the cat) would cause the wave function to collapse, even if there is no conscious observer present to witness it.</p><p>Me: Superposition is strange</p><p>AI: Yes, superposition is one of the most fascinating and counterintuitive aspects of quantum mechanics. In classical physics, objects have definite properties that we can measure, such as position and momentum. However, in quantum mechanics, particles can exist in a superposition of states, meaning that they can simultaneously possess multiple properties at once.</p><p>For example, a particle can exist in a superposition of two positions, two energy states, or two spin directions, among other properties. This means that until a measurement is made, the particle does not have a definite position, energy state, or spin direction, but rather exists in a probabilistic cloud of all possible states at once.</p><p>While superposition is strange and difficult to understand from a classical perspective, it is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics that has been extensively confirmed by experiments. It is also what makes quantum computers potentially more powerful than classical computers, since they can harness the power of superposition to perform multiple calculations at once.</p><p>Me: So it sounds like you&apos;re saying:</p><ol><li>We have confirmed superposition over and over</li><li>Generally people believe that wave function collapse happens with any environmental contact, not just with a conscious observer</li><li>But if that&apos;s true, that&apos;s where Copenhagen loses credibility, and where many-worlds asserts itself</li></ol><p>So if #1 and #2 are true, that makes many-worlds more likely. Which means there&apos;s a version of me somewhere where I am legally married to a toad. Is that true?</p><p>AI: Yes, it is generally accepted that superposition exists and that any interaction with the environment can cause the collapse of the wave function, not just conscious measurement.</p><p>The Copenhagen interpretation suggests that wave function collapse occurs when a conscious observer makes a measurement, while the many-worlds interpretation suggests that collapse occurs when the particle interacts with its environment, even if there is no conscious observer present.</p><p>If the many-worlds interpretation is true, it would imply that all possible outcomes of a quantum experiment actually occur in separate parallel universes, including the outcome where you are legally married to a toad. However, it is important to note that the many-worlds interpretation is still a matter of debate among physicists and philosophers, and is by no means a proven fact. The concept of parallel universes is certainly fascinating, but it is still very much a speculative idea that is difficult to test experimentally.</p><p>Me: Thanks dawg</p><p>AI: You&apos;re welcome! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask!</p>",2023-02-11 20:37:41,üí¨,202d-93c8
129,Read me first!,https://academia.lot23.com/post/1,"So here's the situation.<br /><br />I've worked in tech for 23 years. The first day of my career was on January 3rd, 2000, a few days after Y2K. Now it's 2023 and throughout my career I've learned a lot. But now I want to head back to academia with an ultimate goal of being a professor one day. <br /><br />When I was interviewing to join the Windows Phone design team in 2010, I was asked where I saw myself in five years. ""Teaching!"" I blurted out, before I realised what I was saying. My interviewer looked surprised. I did too! I hadn't realised until then that my heart was guiding me towards teaching, but it made more sense the more I thought about it.<br /><br />A year later, I was teaching night classes at The Art Institute of Seattle. A year after that, I was running my own full-day design classes around the country and the world. By now I've given lots of talks, run lots of workshops, mentored lots of people, and always had a blast doing it. I am put on this earth to learn a new thing, get excited by it, put my insights into writing, and then teach it to others. Its what I do.<br /><br />But I don't have a master's degree, which I'll need if I want to get very far on the academic track. That means step one is figuring out how to get my master's, and I'm not starting with much knoweledge. I do know that people often struggle with writing a thesis. I know that academia isn't famous for great management skills. I know that politics and grants and bureaucracy can be a bummer. But that's about the extent of my understanding of what I'm signing up for.<br /><br />I started seriously looking into this path about three years ago, right as the pandemic hit. I spoke with the head of a design school, plus the dean. I had many coffee chats with people associated with the university. But in the end I took another job in tech and put my plans on hold.<br /><br />But now I'm dusting off my plans and seeing where they take me. Here we go!",2023-03-16 22:18:49,üéì,8d2f-226c

356,"Ok, here's how it's going",https://academia.lot23.com/post/39,"It's nearly Christmas and I've been feeling the weight of my thesis. I want to be due in mid-March, but technically I have until June to get everything done. That means I'm either 75% or 50% done, depending on how you count it. And honestly, I'm in pretty good shape. But I've still felt adrift and sloggy lately. So I'm going to recount how the last month has been going and point a way forward. But first I'd like to talk about a good breakthrough I had about an hour ago.<br /><br />I like project management. We have a running joke when I work on a design team where I will inevitably go to the whiteboard, make a grid on it, and start counting days until our deadline. To me it's a vital part of the design process. How can you do a great job if you don't know if you have 1 day or 100? You need to chunk things up to understand the schedule. So a minute ago I did that very thing. I had the bright idea to give the upcoming weeks project names, and I based them on early Mac OS X codenames. That means coming up I have these self-contained projects to do:<br /><br />* Kodiak<br />* Cheetah<br />* Puma<br />* Jaguar<br /><br />Seeing things chunked up like this, with cool codenames, and some lofty goals attached to them, is very inspiring. Suddenly I *want* to achieve the goals. But hold that thought ‚Äì another thing I've learned about setting goals is that you need to feel like you can achieve small wins or you'll lose your motivation. If you say you'll run five miles a day in your first week, you won't hit that goal and then all the other goals fall down. So are my goals too aggressive? I don't think so. They're doable without being easy. I feel pretty good about being able to achieve them.<br /><br />So that's my recent breakthrough. From now through Jaguar I have a pretty impactful (yet doable) list of things to tackle, and at that point I'm going to encourage more feedback. Stephen King says ""write the first draft with the door open, and the second draft with the door closed."" I think Jaguar is going to be the point at which I am ready to throw the doors open more broadly and receive more outside feedback. So what brought me to this point? Well, quite a few things while I wandered in the woods.<br /><br />I don't think I mentioned it, but a few weeks ago I registered http://augmented-text.com for hosting this work. That was a nice feeling. I also had recently gotten a workable story arc, a workable series of examples, and a workable chunk of text that I feel pretty good about. All of those felt good.<br /><br />But at the same time I started to realise a few things about myself. First, I am great at recording a bunch of quick punk songs and then making a punk album. But I am less good at meticulously fussing over one long thing over a long period of time. Even the books I've written have been a series of essays or short stories bundled together rather than one epic story that I have to wrangle and keep track of. That's just not something I'm as skilled at, and it was biting me during this project. I enjoyed leaping out ahead and getting a bunch of stuff done quickly. I've been enjoying hacking away at code examples. All of these steps have felt good. But it's the long, ongoing, slow slog that I've been struggling with. I don't think I'm alone in this.<br /><br />Second, I've been grieving a little because I can tell my paper won't be as awesome as I envisioned it originally. When you're in the early stages, it's easy to imagine all the awesomeness you're going to get to. But that's all work that Future You is going to have to handle, so you dream big. But then Future You becomes Present You and you're not as motivated to do all that work. Past You writes checks Future You have to cash. And that's when things fall short. So I've been honest with myself about what I will reasonably be able to get to, and what I won't. It'll still be a good paper. But maybe not as great as I was hoping for.<br /><br />I've been having good talks with Walter, and he's been able to bring in other insights and work for me to consider and fold in. But more tangibly, he told me that I need to be careful with my citations. I've never been great with citations, honestly. I usually write a bunch of stuff without citations, then I have to scramble to back up my points later. He encouraged me to do this work as I'm writing, and not put it off. Very good advice, and in fact that's one of the biggest focal points for Kodiak.<br /><br />I have more to say but I've broken the ice after a long time feeling frozen, so I'll stop there!",2023-12-18 06:53:40,üéì,e478-5666

They are referring to luck as a seasoning on a well-prepared meal. You can&#x2019;t make a meal out of salt, but no meal would be complete without it. That&#x2019;s luck.</p><p>But a lot of people shy away from the word when explaining their path, because they think it will cheapen their success. After all, luck is random and hard work is objectively true and noble. Why give credit to things you can&#x2019;t control? The ego wants to take credit for the whole thing. &#x201C;Of course I did a good job, and of course I did it all by myself with perseverance and hard work,&#x201D; the ego claims. But luck knows better.</p><p>I have had a very lucky life. But that doesn&#x2019;t mean I&#x2019;ve been on the couch eating bon-bons and hoping good things magically fall in my lap. I&#x2019;ve worked hard, like we all have. But I see it as a fundamental act of self care and awareness to remind myself to feel gratitude for luck. For example, if I send out 100 applications and only 1 leads to a job, how can you not feel appreciative of those odds? The 100 applications was my hard work. The 1 response was luck.</p><p>So this is a collection of stories of my life that centre around the magical powers of luck, serendipity, and relying on others to do things I can&#x2019;t do alone. In these stories, you&#x2019;ll see me working hard, like we all do, but you&#x2019;ll also see that hard work alone can&#x2019;t come close to explaining why things work out the way they do. Other things are always in play.</p>",2023-06-02 21:35:20,üí¨,b8b9-fa47

I found myself slackjacked at how effortlessly Henry could communicate on the screen with so little. I‚Äôm a little embarrassed to admit it, but I sent him a quick DM telling him how impressed I was by his acting. I am not a person that DMs celebrities. But for him I couldn‚Äôt¬†resist.</p><p>Well. Causeway takes Jennifer Lawrence at her best, quite like her Winter‚Äôs Bone performance, and pairs her with Brian Tyree Henry, who is also at his best. I found myself rewinding and watching scenes a second time, and then a third, and then carrying my iPad to show my wife. ‚ÄúLook at this scene,‚Äù I‚Äôd say. ‚ÄúNothing happens, but, like <em>everything</em> happens.‚Äù And she‚Äôd watch, then she‚Äôd nod, and add her own insights. ‚ÄúDid you see how she reflected his line back in the way she phrased her delivery? Wow.‚Äù</p><p>The movie just ended and I wanted to tell someone about it.

I put in some tomatoes to try and offset it some, but ... we should make something else for them."" This is a surprising result, because I only used half of the spices the recipe calls for. I think I measured something wrong.<br /><br />But the chilli was good! Elliott had three large bowls, Sarah said she liked it, it was just too hot for her, and I really enjoyed it too.

<blockquote><p><strong>The Golden Gate Bridge</strong></p>
<p>I had always heard stories about the area around the bridge, but I never checked it out myself. Apparently you‚Äôre supposed to take the first exit when you hit the Marin side, and there‚Äôs stretches of wilderness, beach, etc. Supposed to be magical.</p>

<p><strong>The Rainbow Tunnel</strong></p>
<p>Drive a bit north and you through one or two tunnels. One has a rainbow across the front of it. Sarah and I hold my breath when we go through it - harder when we were driving in her old VW Superbeetle.</p>

<p><strong>The Other Side of the Rainbow Tunnel</strong></p>
<p>One night I was driving home from Santa Cruz and I got into a friendly race with a souped up sport car. It was totally a Fast &amp; the Furious Situation. We raced each other to each red light in the city, then raced over the bridge (side note: I was piloting a 1984 Honda Accord), then up the hill to the Rainbow Tunnel, then through it‚Ä¶</p>
<p>On the other side of the tunnel, there‚Äôs this fun downhill stretch. Well, this sports car made it clear that he had been teasing me all this way - because once we made it through the tunnel, he basically fucking disappeared. Must have been going 120 mph. Whoosh. Gone.</p>
<p>I love that downhill. In the mornings there are fingers of fog, and at the bottom you start seeing marshlands. I was there in the year of El Nino, so you could see the floods all through the area.</p>

<p><strong>Mt. Tamalpias (Mt. Tam)</strong></p>
<p>Mountainbiking was invented on Mt. Tam. It‚Äôs like Rainier up here - everyone‚Äôs very fond of the mountain. You find yourself checking in with it to guide you. And the trails for walking and biking are just wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>San Rafael</strong></p>
<p>The center of Marin. Not as charming as the other towns, but it‚Äôs still pretty cool. Lucas used to be based here. I had several jobs here, including working at a ‚Äúcybercafe‚Äù. And another job doing tech support at an ISP.</p>
<p>It was here, during spring break 1997 that I decided I had to live in the Bay Area. I was in an indie record shop, gawking at the amazing zine selection, talking to the shopkeeper who knew Bill Hicks personally, in the amazing spring weather ‚Ä¶ and I knew I was coming back.</p>
<p><strong>Novato</strong></p>
<p>Much further north - the place you live because you can‚Äôt afford anything in Marin itself. The Marin version of Kent. It‚Äôs a fine area but snobby people would look down on it for not being Ross, or Belvedere, or San Anselmo.</p>
<p><strong>San Quintin</strong></p>
<p>The famous prison is actually in Marin. Crazy! I used to work a real estate job right down the street.</p>
<p><strong>San Anselmo</strong></p>
<p>Sarah‚Äôs town. It was listed in some magazine as ‚Äúthe classic American town‚Äù so for years they had huge tour buses of people gawking at them. It‚Äôs hardly a normal town, but it‚Äôs got a ton of charm. We were married here, and the main street is just so fucking cute.</p>
<p><strong>Sleepy Hollow</strong></p>
<p>The neighborhood Sarah grew up in. Unincorporated from San Anselmo.</p>
<p><strong>Fairfax</strong></p>
<p>Where I lived. Total hippie town, though by now I bet it‚Äôs just a bunch of lawyers. Jerry Garcia may be buried here? If not, there‚Äôs a plaque in the park at least. Head shops. Great coffee (so I‚Äôm told). Art. A movie theatre I love. Tons of things to draw. Surrounded by parks and beauty.</p>
<p>When you drive through Fairfax, you immediately begin climbing elevation to go towards the redwood forests and the beach. But first you drive through a bunch of Marin-style farmland.</p>
<p><strong>Redwoods</strong></p>
<p>A very special place.</p>
<p><strong>Bolinas</strong></p>
<p>Probably Sarah‚Äôs favorite place in the Bay Area. The locals try to stop tourists from finding them.</p>
<p><strong>Stinson Beach</strong></p>
<p>A beach. Pretty.</p>
<p>When I was having a tough time living on my own, supporting myself, and I had no fucking money, I did the same thing every time. Drive into the woods. Drive to the beach. Breathe. It‚Äôs a healing area.</p>
<p><strong>Berkeley</strong></p>
<p>I used to think Oakland was crime &amp; factories and Berkeley was college professors smoking pot. It‚Äôs (obviously) more nuanced than that. I am in love with Berkeley. It‚Äôs not as picture perfect as I thought ‚Ä¶ but that makes me love it more. Love this area. So does everyone else.</p>
<p><strong>Oakland</strong></p>
<p>More awesome than I realized at first.</p></blockquote>


<p>Ten years ago, I found out that my friends were moving from Seattle to San Francisco. I started a quick little blog to help share information with them about my one year experience in the Bay Area.</p><p>It&rsquo;s fun looking back on this post because a lot of things are the same.

204,Surprise! Explorables have a ton of citations already,https://academia.lot23.com/post/12,"A few days ago I scraped a bunch of websites and automatically made screenshots from them. Then I did a bunch of manual work to record all of them, find broken links, highlight promising examples, and so forth. I didn't finish that work yet, but it did give me a good sample of the sort of material I have to work with. But I'm not doing this research to catalogue a bunch of websites, I want to address larger issues around how product design and play can be used to teach better.<br /><br />So I headed off to Google Scholar, a website I had forgotten exists. I've probably only used it twice before this week, but I have a feeling it's going to turn into one of my most important tools on this journey. I typed ""explorable explanations"" and got 190 results! That was a surprise, I would have expected about 5, tops. 190 results is a big deal, because it means I can figure out what a bunch of academics have discovered, then pivot off that.<br /><br />I was excited to see one research paper say something like ""determining whether or not Explorable Explanations are more effective than traditional teaching techniques is beyond the scope of this research."" Because that's one of the things I'm most eager to figure out! I feel like I have a whole new gold mine of information to explore. Screenshots of Explorables are fine ... but first I want to scape all 190 citations, figure out what they're all saying, and use that to inspire my next steps.

263,One day I won‚Äôt have this,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/one-day-i-wont-have-this/,"<p>I have certain go-to tricks I can use in my life to feel better. One example is sitting down to write quickly. I love the feeling of having an idea and willing my fingers to keep up with my brain while I export a bunch of feelings from my brain and onto the page. Another is drawing, especially comics. Nearly every time I try drawing a comic, I feel relief about how accurately I was able to express myself with little doodles and talk bubbles. Both of these feel great.</p><p>Or what about going on walks, or biking, or playing sports? In all three cases, I wonder to myself why I don&#x2019;t get out more. In all three cases, I&#x2019;m always left feeling better than when I started. It&#x2019;s as close as I&#x2019;ve found to a life cheat code. It&#x2019;s like magic.</p><p>One day I won&#x2019;t have all of this. Maybe I&#x2019;ll get Parkinson&#x2019;s Disease and I won&#x2019;t be able to reliably work a keyboard anymore, or go on walks. Maybe I&#x2019;ll get cancer and go through lots of treatment that leaves me feeling completely erased, so exhausted that it doesn&#x2019;t even seem physically possible. Maybe I&#x2019;ll lose my vision entirely, leaving me to figure out how to be happy staying more still, without the ability to drive, walk, or ride a bike. Without an ability to type or draw. Some day any one of these things are possible.</p><p>What will I do then? I have so many sure-fire tricks for navigating my life in a happy and satisfied way. But if I couldn&#x2019;t use them anymore, what&#x2019;s left? Who am I if I can&#x2019;t draw, write, and go a million miles per hour? I&#x2019;d still have the ability to listen, and maybe I&#x2019;d have the ability to talk. Can that be enough? One day it will have to be, so I should start shoring up those new skills while I can.</p>",2023-06-19 05:11:25,üí¨,674c-317b
72,10 and 2 and GIFs,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/10-and-2-and-gifs/,"<p>They teach people to hold their hands on the steering wheel on &#x201C;10 and 2.&#x201D; But what if that wasn&#x2019;t technically the best positioning? What if the best location was actually more like &#x201C;between 9 and 10 on the left and 2 and 3 on the right?&#x201D; Which would be better, the one that&#x2019;s technically more accurate, or the one that can be explained more clearly?</p><p><br>In 1999, I answered a question on a university test. It asked how to pronounce GIF. I was asked if it should rhyme with &#x201C;jiff&#x201D; or have a hard g. My response was &#x201C;Technically it&#x2019;s jiff but I pronounce it the other way, with a hard G.&#x201D; Which frustrated my teacher, who wrote in red pen &#x201C;Why would you say it wrong?&#x201D;</p><p>But I was frustrated by her frustration. I don&#x2019;t think saying it the way 90% of people pronounce it should be considered &#x201C;wrong.&#x201D; And I don&#x2019;t think just because the creator says it the other way that we consider his approach unequivocally &#x201C;right.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s &#x2026; the way he pronounces it as the inventor, sure. But that&#x2019;s different from saying it&#x2019;s right or wrong.</p><p>Another example is computer security. Changing your passwords frequently is a good idea. But what if you work at a company that requires you to change your password every day? Would that be more &#x201C;right&#x201D; than a company that only asks you to update it every year? Yes and no. It&#x2019;s more secure at first &#x2026; but if your password changes that frequently, you&#x2019;re more likely to write it on a sticky note or do other unsafe things with it. So by being more &#x201C;right&#x201D; you end up with a worse outcome. I love examples like this.</p><p>I think &#x201C;right&#x201D; and &#x201C;wrong&#x201D; needs to factor in human elements like sticky notes on monitors, or the reality that it&#x2019;s easier to remember easy things than hard things. Wrong is so much more interesting than a binary expression. It&#x2019;s the details and the nuances of &#x201C;wrong&#x201D; that make things interesting.</p>",2023-01-21 00:20:49,üí¨,23d5-1fd1

Call me naive, but I assumed that academia would have figured out that HTML is a much better format than PDFs if you actually, like, want people to be able to read your stuff. (Funny that I'm investigating if Explorables are a better way to communicate, and will probably be expected to deliver my findings in ... a dumb PDF file. Ugh)<br /><br />So I have 20 papers in the wrong format. So I found a way to easily scrape all the text out of those PDFs, which worked great. Next I want to find a way to summarise each of them with chatGPT, but chatGPT limits requests to 1000 characters or whatever. So I may have to lean on my fancy new vector database that I figured out two weeks ago.<br /><br />It's sort of incredible watching myself complex tasks in one hour that might have taken me two weeks if I had tried it a few years ago. I picked a very good time (and skillset) for processing through a ton of online data. Scraping and automating is fair game, but it feels like cheating.",2023-04-27 09:19:18,üéì,aba7-5561

134,"What does an academic do, anyway?",https://academia.lot23.com/post/4,"I know a few things about how to get a job in tech, but I know next-to-nothing about how things work in academia. What makes a good academic in the eyes of the university? What are common pitfalls? What sorts of person does well? What sorts of habits get people in trouble? What does success look like for everyone involved?<br /><br />To find out, I‚Äôve cast a wide net. I‚Äôve read books, watched YouTube videos, listened to podcasts, interviewed people, and tried to spot trends and themes. Here are a few things that seem to be true.<br /><br />First, grant-writing is a thing. You don‚Äôt get to show up, say you want to work on topic X, and simply work on topic X. You need to figure out a way to get paid to work on topic X. You need to make it worthwhile for the school. You need to give back. And that all makes sense.<br /><br />I spoke with someone whose parents were both professors with PhDs, and called herself an academic brat. When I told her that I wanted to work on things aligned with what grants would pay for, and what would help the University look good, she said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a horrible approach! This is your life‚Äôs work! Pick something you really want to spend a lot of time on, not something just because you think the school wants you to think about it!‚Äù Fair enough.<br /><br />But if I‚Äôm deeply interested in five things, but four are hard to justify in a grant application and one leaps off the page as highly relevant in the eyes of the university or people with money to spend‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd pick the popular one! This isn‚Äôt a matter of picking something I love versus something I hate, it‚Äôs a matter of choosing between two (or five) things I love, which  seems like a smart thing to do.<br /><br />I had another meeting with someone who told me her job as a lecturer is 40% teaching, 40% research, and 20% giving back to the community. That sounds amazing. My three favourite things are learning new things, writing about them, and then teaching others about them. So that seems pretty well lined up with my interests and my personality. I can do that!<br /><br />But that part will come later, when I‚Äôm a lecturer. More short term, I want to work on my masters, so it‚Äôd be good to pick a topic for my masters. What should I study?",2023-03-24 05:23:30,üéì,931d-c032

192,I've got a list of questions,https://academia.lot23.com/post/10,"I write more about productivity than anyone I know. And it's not because I was born with a natural gift, it's more notes that I write to myself to keep myself on track. But after all these years, yeah, now I'm pretty good at getting things done. It's been a long road!<br /><br />And speaking of a long road, I know that the research I'm about to take on can have a sirens-like effect, where I get so interested in rabbit holes that I crash into the shore. It's a mixed metaphor, but applicable. Show me a writer that's ""doing research for their novel,"" and 9 out of 10 times, that person is not actually writing. Which is fine ... to a point. I'd much rather creative folks over-emphasise creating than researching, because I know that each day without progress is a day falling further from succeeding. So I'm feeling myself reaching for some of my time-worn strategies for getting on track. <br /><br />One of my favourite techniques is coming up with an unrealistic deadline, like ""what would you present if you only had a month instead of a year?"" Another is ""if you could only pick one question to answer, what would you pick?"" followed by ""you're not allowed to disagree with the premise of the challenge or try to combine multiple things into one. Pick one, and only one."" A third is to stay super tangible, with clear questions that need answering. So here's how I'm going to respond to those very provocations:<br /><br />1. If I only had a month, I'd say ""ack!"" and I'd bring my scope way, way in. I could get it done, I'd just have to be more targeted. Which leads to item two, what's the question I'm trying to solve?<br /><br />2. I have to say that I disagree with the premise of this challenge. But with that out of that way, FINE, I would catalogue every example of Explorable Explanations I can find on the internet. I'd document it in a single place and align it with Bret Victor's original definitions for what an Explorable Explanation is. (If I was allowed to pick a second question, it'd be around the effectiveness of this media type)<br /><br />3. So. Tangible, you say? Simple. I'm going to make a master spreadsheet of every example I can find. I am going to add columns for the three things Bret Victor says are required for something to be an Explorable Explanation. Lots of things only do one or two out of three, so I'm curious to know how many actually hit the high bar he's set.<br /><br />So that's the one question that I'll be answering, with one tangible deliverable, delivered over the course of a month. Everything that's not that needs to be parked. I've got some research to do.<br />",2023-04-23 06:51:26,üéì,4087-bc35

182,Things are getting clearer,https://academia.lot23.com/post/8,"Today I had a wonderful two hour visit with the person who could end up being my advisor, and learned a lot. Here's a summary of how things look as of now.<br /><br />**I can still work full time**<br /><br />I could quit my job to work on my Master's, but it'd be better if I don't have to. Yes, I'd need to work hard. Yes, I'd be juggling two big things. But I've raised three kids, including twins. I can handle juggling. And as Walter pointed out, I'm already doing this work.<br /><br />**My proposal should work**<br />I wrote up a proposal not knowing what a good research proposal looks like, and it seems like my proposal should work pretty well. Glad to hear it! All of this is new to me, so I'm not taking anything for granted.<br /><br />**My proposal, summarised**<br /><br />I want to study and next-generation storytelling techniques with an eye towards making designers better communicators. Today we use static images, presentations, and perhaps motion studies or prototypes to get our ideas across, but increasingly that's not enough. There are better communication techniques being used today, and I'd like to chronicle them, draw attention to them, and help inspire a new generation of designers to understand how to author them.<br /><br />Take a look at [The Parable of the Polygons](https://ncase.me/polygons/). It's not quite software, and not quite an essay. The interactive elements and the text are perfectly balanced against each other instead of being an afterthought. If you read a blog post and skip the images or video, it still works. But for Parable of the Polygons, the interactive elements are a required part of the message. This is a technique that has a variety of names but [""explorable explanations""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explorable_Explanation), is the phrase with the most weight behind it. There are tons of other examples of this sort of media, including [The Evolution of Trust](https://ncase.me/trust/), anything [Bartosz Ciechanowski](https://ciechanow.ski/archives/) does, and if you squint, [Universal Paperclips](https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html).<br /><br />**My theory and my end goal**<br /><br />I have a theory that explorable explanations are a much more effective teaching tool than boring white papers, droning lectures, or dense books. I have nothing against other forms of media, but if we measure success in education by ""how many people actually understand the concept you just attempted to teach,"" I suspect that explorable explanations would score much higher than standard teaching methods.<br /><br />So I want to draw a circle around this style of teaching, draw attention to it, understand how it works, what inspires people to utilise it, document great examples of it in use, and teach it to creative folks who are attempting to be more effective in their communication. I want teachers to teach better and I want designers to communicate better. And I think that starts by showing examples of how things can be better.<br /><br />**Maybe I'll go for a PhD?**<br /><br />In my family, I'm the arty one. I've never considered getting a PhD before now, but this research touches on so many interesting topics that I could easily see this research rolling into something bigger and more long term. To consider.<br /><br />**Stay tuned**<br /><br />That's a good summary for now. I have some thinking to do.<br />",2023-04-14 04:56:33,üéì,ef7d-3030
234,Processing data,https://academia.lot23.com/post/21,"There's a wonderful new website called ChatPDF.com that lets you upload a PDF and ask questions about it. For example, you can upload a PDF about ethical research and ask for a summary. Or ask about common mistakes people make, or what sorts of research don't require any legal or moral considerations. It's a fantastic resource, and I used it for all of the files sent from school.<br /><br />To be clear, I also read the documents themselves. But it's a great help to have the raw materials side-by-side with a tool that helps me summarise key concepts or pull out certain forms of information. For example, I couldn't quite understand what it was saying about desks (they talk about having a right to have a place to work, even if you don't have your own desk) so I asked ChatPDF and got a deeper understanding of it straight away. It was pretty great.<br /><br />I'm already inspired to use some of my code/design skills to help me with my journey. For example, if the documentation says I have two weeks to do X and two more weeks to do Y, the information feels a bit out of range and a bit too manual. First I have to find the information in a PDF, then I have to calculate my start date in my head from there. But how nice would it be to have a simple webpage where you can enter in a date and it can automatically calculate each of the due dates? It's such a small example, but still valuable. And in fact it has a direct application to what I want to study.<br /><br />Speaking of what I want to study, here's a refresher.<br /><br />I want to compare different vehicles for learning, e.g<br /><br />* Reading a book or whitepaper<br />* Attending a lecture live<br />* Watching a recorded lecture with Soundcloud-style callouts for key moments or a chat room<br />* Reading content with interactive components<br /><br />So in this example, I have a hypothesis that reading 10 different PDFs manually will have a lower success rate than a webpage that joins the content into a single, cohesive whole. Imagine starting your Master's program and typing your start date into a form, and automatically getting a readout of important dates. Already that's easier and faster than calculating it yourself.

158,Everyone‚Äôs Overwhelmed,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/everyones-overwhelmed/,"<p>I&#x2019;m going to write this in two parts, a summary and more lengthy stuff. It seems cruel to approach an article about being overwhelmed any other way. It&#x2019;d be like saying &#x201C;no one likes root canals, climb into this chair where I&#x2019;ll give you a root canal.&#x201D;</p><p>So here we go, summary followed by root canal.</p><h3 id=""summary"">Summary</h3><p>People have felt overwhelmed for decades, but especially the last decade, but especially the last few years, but especially now, and even if 2023 weren&#x2019;t insane (which it is) it&#x2019;s still happening RIGHT NOW which makes it even more big feeling. Then here comes chatGPT and it&#x2019;s causing all sorts of feelings from wariness to boredom to excitement to fear. On top of that, EVERYONE is is rushing to share what they think about it, which makes the overload and overwhelming feelings feel even worse. The end. That&#x2019;s the summary.</p><p>Now, climb into this chair if you&#x2019;re interested in seeing me perform a root canal!</p><h3 id=""here%E2%80%99s-where-i%E2%80%99m-coming-from"">Here&#x2019;s where I&#x2019;m coming from</h3><p>I write a zine called Near Future Field Notes where I try to think ahead a year or two. I used to write a blog called Fuck Jetpacks where I very specifically was not thinking long term. I very carefully was aiming my writing at things happening now, because there&#x2019;s more than enough content in the current moment, thank you very much. A few years ago I wrote Megaphone Cyclone, where I interviewed a bunch of people about how they handle information overload. A few years before that I was interviewed for a design thing where I was described as the Twitter designer who eschews social media.</p><p>So it&#x2019;s safe to say that this sort of thing is in my wheelhouse. I have always held social media and fanciful jetpack thinking at a distance, but I also love thinking about what&#x2019;s going on now. And gosh a lot is going on now. So much. Gosh. Where do we even-</p><p>[Youth on YouTube-style abrupt jump cut to next section]</p><h3 id=""there%E2%80%99s-no-wrong-way-to-feel"">There&#x2019;s no wrong way to feel</h3><p>I have seen a spectrum of feelings about not just chatGPT but all sorts of things happening in society. And not just this month, but for years. Pre-Covid, during-Covid, this now period where we didn&#x2019;t beat Covid but we&#x2019;ve moved on. Lots of people are feeling a lot of things all the time all at once forever, turned to 11. Hey did you know Trump was indicated? AAAAAA</p><p>So to the people who are excited to ignore LLMs the way they ignored NFT the way they ignored Twitter the way they ignore politics because it&#x2019;s so loud all the time, I get it. I think this is the right way to handle it. On the other hand, the people who are excited to learn more, or scared about AI killing us all, yes. I also think that&#x2019;s the right way to handle it. These are all valid ways to feel, not just because people get to react how they want. But because like a death in the family, big news causes people to process differently. That&#x2019;s normal and good.</p><h3 id=""ar-versus-ai"">AR versus AI?</h3><p>Apple&#x2019;s AirPods Pro have a feature called Transparency Mode. When you turn it on, you can hear the world around you perfectly clearly &#x2026; and yet music is layered on top. It&#x2019;s really useful for enjoying music in a household where people are calling you all the time, or while walking in a city where cars are trying to run you over.</p><p>At first, I didn&#x2019;t get the feature. &#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t that how headphones always work?&#x201D; No, actually. Normal headphones block more sound than Transparency Mode, which is why someone called it &#x201C;AR for your ears.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s a great way to put it. The feature allows the real world and the layered music to be in perfect balance with each other, which is a huge deal.</p><p>Yesterday I realised that &#x201C;Augmented Reality&#x201D; and &#x201C;Artificial Intelligence&#x201D; can be mashed together to make a new (to me) phrase: &#x201C;Augmented Intelligence.&#x201D; When you don&#x2019;t know what movies Matthew Broderick has been in, IMDB easily layers its data onto your brain and the conversation you&#x2019;re having to remind you of Biloxi Blues. When you don&#x2019;t know directions, Google Maps layers itself onto your brain and your navigational situation to tell you how to get somewhere. You&#x2019;re experiencing the world but using data sources to be smarter about it.</p><p>Ok. So hold that thought.</p><p>I&#x2019;m not bullish on VR or AR in the near-term. I&#x2019;ve read a lot of books, I&#x2019;ve been involved in research projects, I&#x2019;ve done a lot of client work, and I just don&#x2019;t see it. Putting your head in a box (VR) is a non-starter. Overlaying a few icons or words on real life (AR) is fine &#x2026; but the experience ROI isn&#x2019;t there and won&#x2019;t be there for a while. (One day it will be there, and it will change a lot, but it&#x2019;s a ways out.)<br></p><p>But you know what I&#x2019;m really excited by? Augmented Intelligence. I don&#x2019;t want to overlay an icon on my glasses to show me how to get to my destination. But I do want to tell Expedia my travel plans, my dietary restrictions, some side trips I was hoping to try out, my frequent flyer info, etc etc and know that it&#x2019;s going to return REALLY GREAT TRAVEL PLANS to me without all the fiddly forms I have to suffer through today. Seriously, fuck multi-page web forms. They&#x2019;re going the way of the typewriter, and quicker than we think.</p><p>So chatGPT feels about a million times more valuable to me than overlaying data on my glasses, or worse, making me put my head in a fishbowl to have a Zoom chat in virtual space. Maybe a billion. That&#x2019;s partially because I think VR is dumb and partially because AI is already that transformational. Today.</p><h3 id=""apps-versus-operating-systems-versus-vertical-integration"">Apps versus operating systems versus vertical integration</h3><p>A set of features makes an app. Those apps have to live someplace, so they live on an operating system and hardware device. But if you&#x2019;re really lucky (Apple) you can actually tie multiple products together into a single large organism. Business people call this vertical integration, Tim Urban might call this a &#x201C;Giant,&#x201D; but for me it&#x2019;s the most exciting story in all of tech.</p><p>We don&#x2019;t want products to show seams. The idea that your TV is doing one thing, your phone is doing another thing, your laptop is doing another thing, your smart home is doing another, your car is doing another, etc etc is old-world thinking but it&#x2019;s the best all the non-Apple companies can pull off.</p><p>But designers such as myself have painted a better picture for a long time: you should be able to walk from your car to your house to your laptop without having to do anything. Everything should lock or unlock automatically, with no user interaction, because you&#x2019;re part of a single experience. And that&#x2019;s only possible to build if a company controls &#x201C;the whole widget.&#x201D; Which only Apple does. For example, when I do a workout on my TV, my Apple Watch can show my heart rate in real time on the TV. It&#x2019;s a small feature that points to a much bigger end goal, and a level of seamlessness that&#x2019;s unimaginable today.</p><p>Design is changing away from features and apps into something far grander and better for end users. (Did I mention fuck forms, like long ones that time out halfway through a job application? What about the fact that every new medical appointment you go to requires hand-writing on a piece of paper that someone has to type into a computer that isn&#x2019;t synchronised anywhere?)</p><p>So as an old designer, making features and apps isn&#x2019;t particularly exciting anymore. But building an operating system? Or even better, a series of products that all hang together into a cohesive whole? That&#x2019;s cool. That&#x2019;s really cool. And that&#x2019;s something that only Apple has has the pieces for for the last decade or so &#x2026; and then chatGPT came out swinging and changed everything.</p><h3 id=""chatgpt-strikes-at-the-heart-of-apple%E2%80%99s-weaknesses"">chatGPT strikes at the heart of Apple&#x2019;s weaknesses</h3><p>AI will make apps obsolete, but won&#x2019;t stop there. It will also make the traditional OS less of a gatekeeper than we&#x2019;re used to. Recall that this already happened to Microsoft&#x2019;s monopoly when the internet hit the mainstream. For a long time, you needed Windows to run the latest apps and games, or else why even own a computer? But with the internet, suddenly Windows didn&#x2019;t matter as much as connecting online (which it wasn&#x2019;t great at). When feature #1 is &#x201C;does it get online,&#x201D; you can set yourself apart by explaining how easy it is to get online. And that&#x2019;s why the iMac was marketed the way it was. Guess what the &#x201C;i&#x201D; stood for. It wasn&#x2019;t Intel or Intuit, gang.</p><p>In the near-future, you&#x2019;ll have a personal assistant that knows what you&#x2019;ve already watched on Netflix, where you like to vacation, what books you want to read next, who your family is and what their quirks are, and everything else. You&#x2019;ll just say &#x201C;Give me 5 budget vacation ideas&#x201D; and it will know your wife has a gluten intolerance, your daughter is in a wheelchair, you just went to Bend, Oregon, and you prefer not to fly. It also knows the word &#x201D;budget&#x201D; means different things to different people, but for you it means no more than $1000 total. That&#x2019;s powerful stuff that will change the whole world.</p><p>Meanwhile, Siri can&#x2019;t even get a simple song request right.</p><p>Apple is in trouble, and that&#x2019;s not something I can remember saying about anything in recent memory. They&#x2019;re obsessed with privacy (good), they&#x2019;ve struggled with Siri (bad but not a dealbreaker until now), and they have nothing to do with chatGPT or any other LLM we know about. As apps become less impactful, and the operating system becomes a game of &#x201C;how intelligently can you speak with AI,&#x201D; the very things that are needed to survive in the next wave are things that Apple struggles with.</p><p>I could use lots of examples, but I&#x2019;ll pick one. Do you think Apple would allow any search result on an Apple product to potentially be wrong? Super wrong? Legal-trouble wrong? Not the Apple I know! And that&#x2019;s just the start of the many Achilles&#x2019; Heels that Apple is bringing into this-</p><p>[I go to DuckDuckGo and type &#x201C;how did Achilles die&#x201D; and get a bunch of bad results. I go into chat.openai.com and get the right answer immediately without having to click anywhere]</p><p>-Trojan War. It&#x2019;s gonna get intense. I&#x2019;m curious to see how Apple manages this transition because an AIMac probably isn&#x2019;t in the cards.</p><h3 id=""i-don%E2%80%99t-know"">I don&#x2019;t know</h3><p>A lot of things are happening, but I think it&#x2019;s pretty easy to go up a level and see a general story arc. One, AI will change everything down to the studs. Two, there&#x2019;s going to be a ton of noise but it&#x2019;ll all boil down to the same thing: the AI is getting smarter and more capable, day after day, year after year. And three, it&#x2019;s hard to know what the end result is. But the future is racing towards us faster than it ever has in recorded history, and we&#x2019;re about to see new companies thrive, some old companies disappear, and everyone in between have to change in significant ways.</p><p>Exciting? Scary? There&#x2019;s no right way to feel. But we&#x2019;re in it now.</p>",2023-04-01 00:04:30,üí¨,dc75-74d8
135,What should I study?,https://academia.lot23.com/post/5,"I‚Äôm blessed with a decisive nature. I pick a thing and get on with it. I like to analyse options and I like to pick well, but I don‚Äôt believe perfection exists. Past a certain point, I don‚Äôt think putting off a decision leads to better results. Read up, make your choice, then put in the work to make it successful. Simple.<br /><br />So when I think about what I want to study, I‚Äôm not particularly fussed about ‚Äúgetting it right.‚Äù Maybe I dive deep on decentralised social networking, a topic close to my heart since working at Twitter. And maybe halfway through I realise I really should have focused on media literacy or using design to communicate more effectively, two other things I care about a lot. That‚Äôs fine! I can do those later!<br /><br />Or what if I decide to study generative art, a topic I‚Äôve played with for over two decades and would love to spend focused time on? That sounds cool, but maybe halfway through I decide that generative art is too abstract and I really should have spent my time on a chatGPT-powered product, since it‚Äôs clear the world is in the process of changing forever. Great! I won‚Äôt mind. It‚Äôs all fun to think about, and it‚Äôs only a one year process, not a life sentence.<br /><br />So, gun to my head, what would I pick if I had to choose today? I have no idea! And not because I don‚Äôt have ideas, or because I‚Äôm scared of picking the wrong thing. But because it‚Äôs been driven into me that ‚Äúfollowing my own bliss‚Äù isn‚Äôt as smart as addressing a real human need.<br /><br />Let‚Äôs say I really want to open a deli on 4th street. If I don‚Äôt do my research and understand that there are already 4 delis within 3 blocks of my location, I‚Äôll enter a crowded market. At that point, my ‚Äúbliss‚Äù won‚Äôt matter because no one‚Äôs bliss is running a failing business. But what if I learned that a beloved tapas place just closed down, and the neighbourhood is looking for a replacement? It‚Äôd be smart to consider that, because your bliss should be more oriented around success than anything.<br /><br />Maybe I‚Äôm just speaking for me?<br /><br />So once I figure out what the university is looking for, and where the grand money is, and what seems to have a high potential for growth, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll be excited about. That‚Äôs where I‚Äôll find my bliss. The only way this can backfire is if nothing I care about is seen as relevant to the academic community. But it‚Äôs hard to imagine that being a problem.<br /><br />We‚Äôll see!",2023-03-24 05:45:41,üéì,1f75-157c

206,"6 May, 2023",https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/6-may-2023/,"<p>Today I woke up, walked the dog, fed the dog, then walked into my office. I could tell the day would be a little bit different based on the order of things. I usually make my breakfast straight away, but in the last few months I&#x2019;ve been postponing it more. Today was a postponement day. It&#x2019;s two hours later and I still haven&#x2019;t eaten breakfast.</p><p>Instead, I tracked down a few bits of research I had started from bed last night and early this morning. I ran a few experiments. I jotted down a few notes. The whole thing was pretty dispassionate, which is notable for me. I spend a lot of time excited by a new thing, but today my excitement was replaced with a mindset of focus and direction.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve been reading research papers, but really only focusing on one. It&#x2019;s not particularly long, and I want to read the whole thing manually to make sure I understand it fully. But as I&#x2019;ve read it, I&#x2019;ve wondered how well chatGPT could summarise it for me. And this morning I formally listed all the ways I could summarise it.</p><ol><li>There&#x2019;s a website called MyAskAI.com where you can upload large documents and ask questions about it.</li><li>There&#x2019;s a Github project called pashpashpash/vault-ai that lets you do the same thing with your own content, on your own site, for free.</li><li>There&#x2019;s typeset.io that helps summarise and analyse research papers, and it also has a Chrome plugin.</li><li>There&#x2019;s pdfgpt.io which takes any PDF and summarises it for you.</li><li>And finally there&#x2019;s my own chatGPT code that I&#x2019;ve been using for a product called TasteBuddy, but I was able to re-wire to summarise large amounts of text.</li></ol><p>I got access to the chatGPT-4 API yesterday, and I wanted to see how that would affect my results. So this morning, a Saturday with nothing on my calendar, I dispassionately tested each one, and now I have results. The overall summary is that the results are good and this is going to save me a ton of time. pdfgpt.io was my favourite, and I suspect I&#x2019;ll be using it a lot.</p><p>There&#x2019;s nothing wrong with dispassionately doing research, of course. But I&#x2019;m feeling my enthusiasm maturing from &#x201C;can you even believe this?&#x201D; and into something more sturdy and mature. Like burning a piece of kindling versus maintaining the embers of a healthy campfire. The first flame is exciting but weak. Burning through hard wood isn&#x2019;t novel, but much more powerful. I&#x2019;ve traded light for heat.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>Last night I went to see Beau Is Afraid, a new movie from the studio that made Everything Everywhere All At Once. The movie is extremely long and self-indulgent. It&#x2019;s not just an art house film, it&#x2019;s purposely confusing and opaque. Many people will hate it. In my showing, I heard people saying &#x201C;what the hell is this movie?&#x201D; and at the end there was nervous laughter. We all left thinking WTF and I&#x2019;ve been thinking about it ever since.</p><p>Coincidentally, ten minutes before walking into the film I recorded a video for some friends where I talked about my theory of how media gets &#x201C;infused with meaning.&#x201D; You can listen to a song on the radio and it won&#x2019;t mean much. But if your best friend were to say it&#x2019;s their favourite song, you&#x2019;d listen to it again with a completely different viewpoint. The song doesn&#x2019;t change, but you do, and I think that&#x2019;s beautiful.</p><p>I went to art school, so we spent a lot of time talking about art and the role of the audience. Through those experiences, I realised I am a hardliner when it comes to art. My standard example is to ask if a crumpled up piece of paper behind glass &#x201C;deserves&#x201D; to be art. Many people say no, I say yes. Art doesn&#x2019;t mean &#x201C;thing I personally like,&#x201D; it&#x2019;s closer to &#x201C;an expression from an artist meant to inspire.&#x201D; If I crumple up a piece of paper, it&#x2019;s crumpled up paper. But as soon as I take a picture of it, send it to a friend, put it behind glass, put a plaque next to it, write an essay about the meaning of it, etc &#x2026; it becomes art. It becomes infused with meaning the moment you ask for comment. That&#x2019;s when it becomes art.</p><p>So watching Beau Is Afraid was quite an experience for me. It&#x2019;s challenging and confusing, and I don&#x2019;t think anyone in my theatre liked it. And yet &#x2026; there&#x2019;s value in that. The movie wasn&#x2019;t &#x201C;bad,&#x201D; it just wasn&#x2019;t what most people would choose to see. And yet the fact that I&#x2019;m still thinking about the movie, and talking to you about it now, and reading analysis online, well, that&#x2019;s something. In fact, it&#x2019;s a lot. The movie is like a coronavirus, perfectly designed with spikes to make it attach to things. You can&#x2019;t watch the movie and ignore it. It begs to be infused with meaning, whether that&#x2019;s people saying &#x201C;well, that&#x2019;s 3 hours of my life I&#x2019;ll never get back&#x201D; or me writing about it here. That is impressive and inspiring. It&#x2019;s the role of art, and I am glad I experienced it. I&#x2019;m glad I can pass it along to you.</p><p>You probably won&#x2019;t like the movie, and yet, perversely, that&#x2019;s beside the point.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>There is truth, and there is art. It&#x2019;s possible they are opposing forces. Both vital, as foundational as fire and water, but no less at odds. When I am experiencing art, there is no objective truth, only experience and infused meaning. When I am researching as an academic, personal opinion is a distraction. I want to find what&#x2019;s objectively true, to whatever degree I can.</p><p>Art is light, and research is heat. We need both.</p>",2023-05-05 22:46:30,üí¨,3dd8-7b11

Sound good?</p><p>--</p><blockquote>I recently discovered that I use my computer as a security blanket, but in a different way than most. Sure, we all are addicted to social media. And yes, many of us spend the day looking at upsetting news. And the word &quot;workaholic&quot; has evolved from something you&apos;d say about a distant 80s-era corporate lawyer to something that many people wear as a badge of honour. So on that level, we&apos;re all addicted to our tech, so of course my computer and phone is a security blanket. But I realised something different. I need my computer not for work, but for my mental health journey.</blockquote><p>--</p><p>chatGPT, that&apos;s the first paragraph. I want the following paragraphs to to talk about how my extreme levels of productivity seem to be a side-effect of how seriously I take my mental health. I set up schedules for myself, I set up software and tools to help me with incentives, I track my physical and mental health with Apple&apos;s health products. And when I don&apos;t have those things, I don&apos;t just struggle feeling aimless at work. I feel my mental health slip, which isn&apos;t a great sign.</p><p>Write me three paragraphs in the way I described.</p><h3 id=""miner-talk-paragraphs-1-3"">Miner Talk, paragraphs 1-3:</h3><p>Now, don&apos;t get me wrong, young &apos;un. We&apos;ve all got this here fever, a certain kind of gold rush, ain&apos;t no actual nuggets involved though. It&apos;s a thirst for that there online world, a hankerin&apos; for likes, shares and what not. Sure as a rattlesnake on a summer&apos;s day, we&apos;re all hoarding our moments, peering at sorrowful headlines, sifting through the tailings of our days with eyes glued to screens. Afore time, a &quot;workaholic&quot; were a feller in a fancy suit, a stranger in some big city law firm. These days, &apos;tis a badge folk wear with odd pride. So yeah, we&apos;re all somewhat beholden to our gadgets, that&apos;s certain as sunrise. But, like stumbling on a rich vein in the rock, I realized I ain&apos;t just using this newfangled tech for the typical toil and sweat. Nay, it&apos;s a linchpin in my journey down the mineshaft of my own mind, digging for a better understanding of my own self.</p><p>Well, diggin&apos; for gold ain&apos;t easy, and neither is maintainin&apos; the tunnels of one&apos;s mind. I reckon my prodigious work ain&apos;t just about striking it rich, it&apos;s the ripples of me tryin&apos; to keep my mental caverns from caving in. I&apos;m a claim-jumper of my own schedule, settin&apos; up my day as meticulously as a miner lays his dynamite. I got tools, not the sort for rock and dirt, but software and whatnot, helpin&apos; me navigate, laying out a map with rewards to spur me on, just as a glint of gold might encourage a weary prospector.</p><p>No Apple ever fell into a miner&apos;s hand, &apos;cept maybe during a lunch break. But in this strange world we live in, &quot;Apple&quot; ain&apos;t just something to nibble on anymore. It&apos;s become a tool for keeping track of the physical and mental workings of a body, like a canary in the coal mine. When I ain&apos;t got these modern wonders at hand, it ain&apos;t just aimlessness that grips me. I feel like a miner who&apos;s lost his pickaxe, can&apos;t keep the mine shaft stable, and it ain&apos;t just the walls of my work day that start to crumble. My mental health begins to waver, teetering like a poorly propped shaft, and that ain&apos;t no good sign for any miner worth his salt.</p><h3 id=""backstage-instruction-22"">Backstage instruction 2/2:</h3><p>Well done! I like that a lot. So we&apos;ve got a pretty good premise, but now we need to find a conclusion. Here&apos;s how the conclusion looks, in my mind.</p><ul><li>Next we need to mention <em>why</em> I have discovered this about myself. So that&apos;s how paragraph four should start. I am on holiday with my family, but I was intending on working through it to save my days off. But -- fuck -- I left my laptop at home. This meant all my vacation days went poof, and it meant I didn&apos;t have access to the tools I use for my mental health. I don&apos;t write a lot because it&apos;s a challenge. I write a lot because <em>not writing a lot is a challenge</em>. So this holiday has been nice, but has put me off-kilter because I don&apos;t have my tools handy. I am a better parent and person when I can work on my brain at points during the day. I write to process things. So make that paragraph 4, to set things up.</li><li>Next I want to refer to this old-timey miner way of speaking, to explain that sometimes it can help to shake up your thinking by putting it through a different filter. I got a lot of benefit from seeing my words translated into another voice. It&apos;s whimsical and silly, but it also triggers a bit of a novelty effect in my mind where the same information feels different when delivered differently.</li><li>Next, I want to point out that discovering the problem and naming it is a big part of the battle. If your car tire is flat, that&apos;s bad. But at least it helps you to understand what to do, then you fix the tire. (We should make that metaphor a mining metaphor, not a car metaphor) In my case, understanding what I&apos;m missing helps me to fix it.</li><li>Then end with a happy conclusion. Because just writing this out has made me feel better (how meta!) so it&apos;s like I both fixed the tire and also write a manual for fixing tires.</li></ul><p>Ok! Go for it! Land this essay!</p><h3 id=""miner-talk-paragraphs-4-7"">Miner Talk, paragraphs 4-7:</h3><p>The reason I&apos;ve been pondering on all this weren&apos;t born in a gold mine or a highfalutin&apos; office, but during a family holiday. The plan was to keep my nose to the grindstone, to save those precious vacation days. But, in a twist that&apos;d make any seasoned prospector holler, I left my blasted computer back at the homestead. My vacation days went up in smoke faster than a stick of dynamite, and it left me without my usual arsenal of mental pickaxes and shovels. Now, I&apos;m not one to pen words because it&apos;s as tough as splitting rocks, but because not doing so is like trying to mine without a pick. This holiday, as soothing as a spring in the desert, has left me feeling as unsteady as a miner in a cave-in, without my tools to prop me up. I&apos;m a steadier hand at parenting, a better person, when I can tend to the veins of my mind throughout the day. I write not just to strike it rich, but to pan through the silt of my thoughts.</p><p>Now, reckonin&apos; about my circumstances through the spectacles of a seasoned gold miner ain&apos;t as far-fetched as it sounds. It&apos;s a way of turning the pan, letting the water sluice through and reveal the nuggets that were hidden. Might be a tad whimsical, sure, but when you&apos;re knee-deep in the stream, sometimes changing the angle of your pan can make all the difference. That&apos;s how we spot those shiny bits of understanding, isn&apos;t it?</p><p>Seeing a problem, like spotting a weak beam in your mine, is quite the challenge. But, once spotted, it gives you something to hammer at. If your tunnel&apos;s unstable, knowing where to place the next beam is half the battle. And writing this out, well, it&apos;s been like setting that beam in place. The tunnel of my mind feels a mite more secure, and I reckon I&apos;ve done more than just patch a problem, I&apos;ve drawn myself a map for future digs.</p><p>And so, it seems the miner in me found a nugget of wisdom in the most unlikely of places. Stranded without my usual tools, I discovered that life, much like mining, ain&apos;t always about the gold rush. It&apos;s about understanding the lay of our own claims and making do with the tools at hand - or, sometimes, making do without them. And while this holiday may have shaken my stability, it&apos;s also given me a blueprint for tackling such obstacles head on. It&apos;s like the old saying goes: the mine may be deep and dark, but there&apos;s always a way to find some gold.</p>",2023-07-13 21:23:03,üí¨,8542-8911

98,A weekly package,https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=52054,"
<p>In 2006 I ran a little social network called bouquet. I've been bringing it back and having lots of fun.</p>
<p>Here's an idea I don't see often enough: posting that waits a week before publishing. The whole point of social networking, at least the way we currently think about it, is to post a thing and IMMEDIATELY get everyone to see it. But what if you posted stuff for a week and then sent it out as a digest instead?</p>
<p>My bouquet site is for tracking stuff you've been up to. Movies you watched, books you read, projects you worked on, drinks with friends, whatever. I might write 5 things in a single day, which is a bit overwhelming on a timeline. But what if those 5 things a day were held back for 7 days, then you see a 35 item update once a week? That could be pretty nice.</p>
<p>So I think I'm gonna do that. Should be cool.</p>

57,Mid-March 2023 Brain Dump,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/mid-march-2023-brain-dump/,"<p>Goodness gracious, ladies and gentlemen. My computer is full of windows, those windows all have too many tabs open, the online discourse is, as I imagine kids in some generation might have said, <em>poppin</em>, and so I&#x2019;m going to try and sort out some thoughts here. Some are about the broader world, some are about me specifically. Let&#x2019;s start there.</p><p><strong>I found a lovely &#x201C;third place&#x201D;</strong></p><p>In Seattle, there&#x2019;s a series of bookstores called &#x201C;Third Place Books.&#x201D; The idea is your first place is home, your second place is work, and they want to be your third place. I love Third Place Books, and I used to visit their pub frequently. It was a great place to write.</p><p>I moved to New Zealand over five years ago, but I&#x2019;ve never been able to figure out a new &#x201C;third place.&#x201D; I&#x2019;ve lugged my laptop to a few bars and had good experiences, but no place that grabbed me as my new place. But this weekend I may have found it. It looks like this and I can&#x2019;t wait to go back.</p><figure class=""kg-card kg-image-card""><img src=""https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/the-champagneria-1245385.jpg"" class=""kg-image"" alt loading=""lazy""></figure><p><strong>I dusted off a 17 year old project</strong></p><p>I used to run a little social networking site and I recently brought it back to help me learn about databases. So far it&#x2019;s gone really well! Today I&#x2019;d like to draw your attention to this <a href=""https://www.loom.com/share/a083e765607b4e7c98e4154fda6648f1?ref=a-blog-about-jon-bell"">quick video of me experimenting with the form</a>.</p><p>What&#x2019;s going on here? Well, I asked chatGPT to help me make a form where you can type what you did that day, and put any emojis at the front of the textfield. Then, when you hit enter, show another form. It took me about a minute to write that description, and the code it returned worked on the first try. It was amazing. (I made this breakthrough at the &#x201C;third place&#x201D; above!)</p><p><strong>I made my first real steps into academia</strong></p><p>I&#x2019;m considering getting my Master&#x2019;s degree, which means I need to switch gears from informational interviews into picking a research direction and applying for it. I reached out to two nice folks and asked for coffee. I got a response and was <a href=""https://www.adamartgallery.nz/events/upcoming/visiting-artists-talk-jodi?ref=a-blog-about-jon-bell"">invited to an art talk</a>. But not just any art talk, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodi_(art_collective)?ref=a-blog-about-jon-bell"">JODI</a>!</p><p><strong>Let&#x2019;s talk about the early 90s net art scene</strong></p><p>At the verrrrrrry start of what we&#x2019;d now call &#x201C;internet culture&#x201D; or being &#x201C;very online,&#x201D; there were some notable internet experimenters and provocateurs. I&#x2019;ve lost track of the hundreds of different sparks I came across over time, but JODI was part of that original big bang. And they&#x2019;ll be visiting Wellington this week!<br></p><p><strong>My networking went even better than expected</strong></p><p>When I mentioned that folks like JODI, Joshua Davis, and the k10k crew had always inspired me, I was invited to dinner/drinks afterwards with JODI and the person who could end up being my advisor when I get my Master&#x2019;s. I can&#x2019;t wait! It&#x2019;s in a few days.<br></p><p><strong>In other academic news</strong></p><p>But before all of that, I&#x2019;m performing a guest lecture tomorrow evening. It&#x2019;s a talk I&#x2019;ve given many times, all around the world. I even designed an entire day-long class around it. So I know the material very well, and I&#x2019;m excited to chat with a new group of students about it. Huzzah!</p><p><strong>What a perfect day</strong></p><p>Wellington is a fascinating city because it has a ton of hikeable green space throughout the middle of everything, plus beaches, plus mountain biking. So yesterday we drove five minutes to Oriental Bay and had what could have been a Hollywood plot-style Perfect Day at the Beach. Ice cream at the end, of course.</p><p><strong>But also hello 2008</strong></p><p>Silicon Valley Bank went into receivership yesterday. Only two things can happen from here: everyone&#x2019;s deposits will either be protected, or they won&#x2019;t. If they are, people will be upset about another big bailout. If they aren&#x2019;t, well, hold that thought.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t like it when people use ellipses all throughout their writing. I especially don&#x2019;t like it when they use two, four, or more dots. I don&#x2019;t like it when people use ellipses as a way of saying &#x201C;I am pondering this concept,&#x201D; and I think the usage of it makes you look like a burned out hippie or high school student.</p><p>But I think that this might be one of the only times I ever thought of using an ellipsis in that way. I want to leave off with a bit of a &#x201C;who knows&#x201D; cliffhanger. I want to explain that I think this will be a big deal one way or another. And so here we go.</p><p>If there&#x2019;s a bailout, people will be upset. But if there isn&#x2019;t &#x2026;</p>",2023-03-11 19:42:34,üí¨,fcd9-23aa
222,Some background on my cooking journey,http://cooking.lot23.com/post/2,"I don't cook much. I can make a homemade pizza. I can throw spaghetti in a big pot, overcook it, and slap some bottled pasta sauce on it. I can make toad-in-a-hole and grilled cheese really well. I can do a thing I call ""Jon Soup"" which is tomato soup, rice, and chopped sausage. Probably some other things, but you get the point. Bachelor food, low quality, bad for you. (Oh, I made tacos once. And I make sandwiches with deli meats.)<br /><br />So that's where I'm coming from. I can feed my kids, technically, but I don't prepare dinners in the traditional way, where I cut vegetables, slave over a hot oven, and so forth. A week of dinners might look like this:<br /><br />2-3 dinners cooked by Sarah    <br />1 night of tater-tots and chicken nuggets  <br />1 night of takeaways (I forget how we say that word in America. To-gos?)  <br />2-3 nights of leftovers  <br /><br />We've been together for 25 years, and I've never been able to cook much. It doesn't mean we sit around and wait for mom to make something. We're more than happy to throw on some pasta, heat up some leftovers, make a homemade pizza, and so forth. There's no *expectation* that Sarah will cook, and for the last two years while she was in school we foraged and did pretty well through her long hours.<br /><br />But if we're going to eat real food, the sort of meal you wouldn't be embarrassed to mention cooking for your kids, there is definitely an expectation that if anyone's gonna do it, it's gonna be Sarah. And that's not good, obviously.<br /><br />This year, as Mother's Day drew nearer, I told Sarah that as an enlightened husband I know that buying a mom cleaning supplies for Mother's Day is bad. And I think the same goes for cooking breakfast or dinner. In an equal partnership, making ONE MEAL shouldn't be seen as a once-in-a-year treat. So I told her that I was going to make dinner on Sunday, but IT WAS NOT A MOTHER'S DAY PRESENT. JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR.<br /><br />She had a good idea. She asked me to take cooking classes, and make *that* my Mother's Day present. Brilliant! I signed up for some classes, and on Mother's Day, my This-Is-Totally-Not-Your-Mother's-Day-Gift dinner was pulled pork cooked with a slow cooker. She told me how to do each step, and I think I should be able to figure it out myself next time.<br /><br />The meal went well! (I also did veggies and potatoes) This week we've been living off of leftovers, and now the weekend is drawing near. I've decided this Sunday I'm going to cook something new. I'm thinking about making chilli. We'll see how it goes!<br /><br /><br /><br />",2023-05-18 19:51:38,üë®‚Äçüç≥,ccf9-5b16
335,The Humane AI Pin,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/the-humane-ai-pin/,"<p>While listening to the wonderful <a href=""https://podcasts.apple.com/nz/podcast/hard-fork/id1528594034?i=1000635157251&amp;ref=a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io"">Hard Fork podcast</a>, my ears perked up when I heard them say that some people think the Humane AI Pin will fail, but a bunch of product types and engineers and saying &#x201C;there&#x2019;s a lot of amazing tech in there.&#x201D; To the host&#x2019;s credit, he then said that both sides can be right. You can have a product with great tech that still fails. Sign me up for that point of view.</p><p>For those that don&#x2019;t know, the Humane AI Pin is a magnetic computer you affix to your shirt. It has a camera for seeing the world and a speaker for talking to you. The best summary for a product like this is simple: &#x201C;what if Siri was great?&#x201D; In the demo, two people speaking different languages can have a conversation because the pin hears each person and translates the text into the other&#x2019;s language. The pin can see that you&#x2019;re holding almonds and tell you how much protein is in them. You can ask the pin to look things up for you on the internet and it will return answers. It&#x2019;s an AI-based, voice-based, internet-connected, $699 computer with a camera and a laser projection system you pin on your shirt like a Star Trek communicator.</p><p>When things like this come out, I am usually on the enthusiastic side of the spectrum, and nearly everyone I know is more on the cynical side. When iPod came out, I bought one immediately. Same with iPhone and Nintendo Switch. I am an early adopter. I overlook the warts in products when I see something useful somewhere underneath it all.</p><p>Another important detail to know about me is that I am not a gadget hound. I do not collect hardware. I don&#x2019;t keep the original packaging. I do not have nostalgia for old technology. I don&#x2019;t care about technology for technology&#x2019;s sake. If I think a product will address a need that I genuinely have, I will buy it. If it&#x2019;s just some neat gadget, but I can&#x2019;t actually fit it into my life, I notice pretty quickly and give up. I feel this way about Android, Raspberry Pi, Miracast, Microsoft&#x2019;s Surface products, Siri, Playstation VR, Smart Home stuff, etc.</p><p>So that&#x2019;s the background. What do I think of the Humane AI Pin? Simple:</p><ul><li>Everyone can benefit from a better Siri</li><li>There are scenarios where you are hands-free, like driving</li><li>Audio is an extremely low bandwidth communication channel</li><li>No one wants to navigate hardware with a laser projection</li><li>No one wants to give up their phones</li><li>Therefore this product will fail</li></ul><p>Being able to talk to a really fantastic Siri has legs, as a concept. What if you could set a phone on the table and have a great conversation translated for you in real time? Or show some almonds to the camera and have it tell you the amount of protein? Or get detailed results from the internet in a conversation, the way the audio version of chatGPT can? All of those scenarios sound great, and will be coming, either via first or third party apps. But none of them require abandoning your phone and using an entirely different piece of hardware. In fact, in each situation, the Humane AI Pin makes it harder than it needs to be, not easier. And for any scenario that is even slightly complex, like ordering dog food, becomes much harder when you have to do it blindly using only voice.</p><p>The best example of their myopic product vision is how they&#x2019;re handling music. Because the pin has no apps, you have to rely on whatever apps they bundled via partnership deals. Did they get Spotify, Apple Music, or Amazon Music as a partner? No. They got TIDAL, a partner and experience that will appeal to practically no one. Whereas if they had accepted that people like their phones, and expect their hardware to augment rather than replace them, it&#x2019;d be a whole different product. A better one. One that might not fail.</p><p>Instead we got this.</p>",2023-11-17 19:40:49,üí¨,74cc-5504

292,I‚Äôm feeling a little better about Vision OS Simulator,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/im-feeling-a-little-better-about-vision-os-simulator/,"<p>Someone on the internet asked me to answer some questions about how the simulator handles 3D space. He wanted to know if the screens float in a spherical canvas only around your head, or if they allow you to place things anywhere in space. In his view, spherical only would be of limited use, but placing anywhere in a space could be helpful. I agree.</p><p>The results are pretty good, but not perfect. I was taught how to move things forward and backward in space on the Z axis, which does in fact allow me to hang things on walls. (The trick is holding shift while dragging) I can also go into different rooms, set things down, move into another room, and still see it there when I return. That&#x2019;s excellent, and mostly negates my previous post where I said I wasn&#x2019;t so sure about the simulator.</p><p><br>The two main issues I&#x2019;m seeing are probably an issue with the simulator itself. First, I find the controls super fiddly and confusing when trying to drive things from a laptop. If the headset UX itself isn&#x2019;t fiddly, great. Plus, every YouTube video I&#x2019;ve seen so far leads me to believe they nailed it. But the second issue is with how the windows &#x201C;flip up&#x201D; while placing them. Imagine holding a screen directly in front of you, but as you tried to look at it, the top of the screen tilted forward and the bottom tilted away. As if it was trying to conform to a spherical canvas around your head. I can&#x2019;t tell if it&#x2019;s a laptop issue, buggy software, or if Apple designed windows to never quite sit where you put them. We&#x2019;ll see!<br><br>But I&#x2019;m feeling better than before about the potential of the device. I suspect the EyeSight feature will invite a lot of criticism and will feel super awkward &#x2026; but people will eventually acclimate to that. They&#x2019;ll never acclimate to a horrible UX, and so far it seems like Apple&#x2019;s in good shape on that front.</p>",2023-07-02 20:10:51,üí¨,937d-c50d

100,"What to Drop, What to Carry",https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=51992,"
<p>Here are some development notes to myself.</p>
<p>The most exciting software that I'm working on is called <a href=""http://firehose.lot23.com"">Firehose</a>. It takes a bunch of my personal RSS feeds and puts them together in one website. A few weeks (months?) ago, it occurred to me that I could save all the entries into a database. How cool would it be to tie your different feeds (Medium, Mastodon, Tumblr, your personal blog, etc) together and then have a copy you could store for yourself? Today, if a website goes out of business, you could lose all your data. But with this plan, you'd have a backup copy. Super cool.</p>
<p>So I went through a process of learning how to make databases work. That finally bore fruit last week, which sent me off into a side project of getting a 16 year old social networking site dusted off and working again. <a href=""http://archive.bouquet.lot23.com"">Here it is!</a> It's called bouquet.</p>
<p>But sometimes it's good to remember why you're doing things. I didn't learn databases so I could dust off my old social networking site. I learned databases so I could do the Firehose backup idea. So I'm going to stop working on bouquet and focus back on Firehose. Wish me luck!</p>

For example, I just saw that Google has an explorables website for showing off AI concepts. It's absolutely perfect for the sort of thing I want to show off. I have some notes for myself detailing what sorts of things I want to highlight. Google, but also Nicky Case (and the Loopy project), https://ciechanow.ski/archives/ and plenty more.<br /><br />I continue to be really happy that I did my MVP sprint at the beginning of the process, because it's easier to see how everything might land.

322,Understanding New Zealand‚Äôs Election Using American Political Metaphors,https://jonbell.medium.com/understanding-new-zealands-election-using-american-political-metaphors-16e8a727ae58?source=rss-15b289981db3------2,"<h3>Understanding New Zealand‚Äôs Election Using American Political Metaphors (1/2)</h3><p>Tomorrow is election day in New Zealand. Labour (NZ‚Äôs version of Democrats) have been in power for the last two terms (six years) and now the polls show that National (NZ‚Äôs version of Republicans) will win. That‚Äôs the summary, but there‚Äôs a bunch of interesting stories just under the¬†surface.</p><h4>Jacinda Ardern burned out and¬†quit</h4><p>You might have heard of Jacinda Ardern, the charismatic, young, and well-spoken Prime Minister (which is like being president) that led New Zealand through the pandemic. You can think of her as similar to Barack Obama. Young, progressive, popular, and despised by her political rivals. Earlier this year, she cited burnout and stepped down from her role, handing the reigns to someone named Chris Hipkins. We‚Äôll get to him in a¬†minute.</p><h4>2020 was a record-breaking election</h4><p>Jacinda Arden didn‚Äôt just win in 2020, her government got higher numbers than anyone else in modern NZ history. Her party‚Äôs approval was off the charts, meaning she won over 50% of the vote, which meant she didn‚Äôt need to partner with other parties. Let‚Äôs talk about that¬†next.</p><h4>Introducing MMP, the opposite of winner-take-all</h4><p>In America, one party wins and the other side loses. It‚Äôs often referred to as ‚Äúfirst past the post‚Äù because it‚Äôs a winner-take-all system. But that‚Äôs not how MMP works. In MMP, you make coalitions across parties in order to get 50% of the vote and take¬†power.</p><h4>How things currently stand</h4><p>NZ has these major parties that are polling at these numbers the day before the election:</p><p>National (Republicans): 36%<br>Labour (Democrats): 27%<br>Green party (Like American‚Äôs Green Party; AOC would be here): 13%<br>ACT (Far right, like Pat Buchannan or Trump): 10%<br>New Zealand First (Also far right, like Pat Buchannan or Trump): 6%<br>Te PƒÅti MƒÅori (blend of left and right, but partner with Labour):¬†3%</p><p>If you combine the parties on the left and the parties on the right, you get these¬†numbers:</p><p><strong>Left:</strong> Labour + Green + Te PƒÅti MƒÅori = 43%<br><strong>Right:</strong> National + ACT + New Zealand First =¬†52%</p><p>So the right is going to win, right? Yes and no. They will get the most votes, but it‚Äôs gonna get spicy. It turns out these parties hate each¬†other.</p><h4>Meet Christopher Luxon</h4><p>Luxon leads the National party, and will be the new prime minister. Think of him like George W Bush. He has no political experience, he used to be a businessman, and he‚Äôs promising to cut government waste and give everyone tax cuts. Analysts have looked into his plan and found that rich people will get most of the benefit of his tax cuts while he slashes social programs to pay for them. You might recognise this as ‚Äútrickle down economics,‚Äù and it‚Äôs Luxon‚Äôs big plan for the¬†country.</p><h4>Luxon will be partnering with Rand Pauls and Trumps,¬†lol</h4><p>Because he‚Äôs polling down at 43%, he‚Äôll need to cobble together support from the anti-immigrant, anti-MƒÅori, anti-social programs, anti-woke, pro-tax cut minor parties. I don‚Äôt need to give them too much explanation; if you know about the alt-right or Trump, they‚Äôll need no introduction. Think Rand Paul, Trump, Buchanan, David Duke, or Matt¬†Gaetz.</p><p>Luxon, unsurprisingly, isn‚Äôt thrilled about this. He‚Äôd prefer his party win enough seats to not have to partner with crazy people, but that‚Äôs not in the cards. So he‚Äôs putting on a brave face, while his partners are saying they‚Äôre going to extract a lot of concessions from¬†him.</p><h4>Who is Chris Hipkins, the Labour¬†leader?</h4><p>Chris Hipkins had the unfortunate role of trying to lead the party after Jacinda Arden. He doesn‚Äôt have the communication skills that she does, and he‚Äôs Prime Minister during a time when kiwis are feeling deeply pessimistic about the country‚Äôs direction. This is a classic ‚Äúchange election‚Äù and there seems to be very little Hipkins can do to keep his party in¬†power.</p><h4>But wait! Labour is¬†surging!</h4><p>It would be very surprising to see the left win this election. And yet, we are seeing a last-minute surge by Labour. Probably too little too late, but it makes for a more interesting election day¬†result.</p><h4>My predictions for¬†tomorrow</h4><p>I‚Äôm going to guess that New Zealand First, Labour, and the Greens do better than expected. I‚Äôm going to guess that ACT and National do worse. So here are my final¬†guesses:</p><p>National: 45<br>Labour: 36<br>Greens: 18<br>ACT: 12<br>New Zealand First:¬†9</p><p>Part two coming¬†soon!</p><img src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=16e8a727ae58"" width=""1"" height=""1"" alt="""">",2023-10-13 07:31:55,üìù,360c-331e
323,Rituals,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/rituals/,"<p>I never went to church with any regularity, but I do appreciate the appeal of a church community. It&#x2019;s a lot easier for &#x201C;it takes a village&#x201D; to do its work when you have a group of people you see at least once a week and are connected to through the church. So what&#x2019;s someone to do if they&#x2019;re not religious but see the benefits of community and ritual? I have no idea how to answer the community question. Reddit, the parents of my kids&#x2019; friends, and the odd social event? It&#x2019;ll have to do. But I did come up with a ritual. It even has a physical totem as part of it!<br></p><p>A few weeks ago I met someone at a zine festival who makes zines to go along with statues he makes. The zines explain a rich world of a billion years ago, when a race of creatures lived on earth. They&#x2019;re written from the point of view of academics who have found various runes, sculptures, and artefacts related to this ancient world and are trying to piece it all together. It&#x2019;s pretty amazing stuff, so I bought a statue. Technically they weren&#x2019;t for sale, but a short chat later I have one!</p><p>So on Sundays, I hold the statue in my hands and read a prayer/mantra that I wrote, taking from the lore of this artist&#x2019;s world. He talks about titans existing under the mantle of the earth, shifting imperceptibly like jellyfish. I take that concept of slow but impactful shifting and tie it together with balance and creativity. It&#x2019;s a statement for the week that lies ahead, and how I hope it holds balance and creation.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve done it for two weeks, and I can already feel the placebo effect taking hold. It means something to me already, and it helps that I have a whole other routine I go through before the statue part. When I&#x2019;m done, I move the statue from one side of my desk to the other. Seeing the position of the item helps me understand cycles and balance in a visual way that I enjoy.</p><p>Midway through last week I decided I wanted a Wednesday mantra too. In the lore of this ancient civilisation, I found a concept of the sun and people who worship it and fire as a driving force that balances dark and light. So now I have a second mantra around balance and focus that I look forward to on Wednesday, the most complex day of my week.</p><p>I made a ritual. It didn&#x2019;t need to come from an ancient book, or from an external source. It came from one artist&#x2019;s imagination, multiplied by my own, and it will only feel more powerful as time goes by.</p>",2023-10-30 09:10:36,üí¨,9011-4a11
324,Rat Man,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/rat-man/,"<p>We were a small startup in 2005, and a few years later we were bought up by a larger business. Everyone got half their salary in a lump sum to share the spoils. We grew a bit, not wildly so, and a few years later I moved to another company.</p><p>Nearly 15 years and a career later, I was getting my things in order to switch countries for good. My new country, New Zealand, had some questions for my prior country, The United States of America. Had I really worked in these jobs? Could I prove it? Was I really healthy, not a criminal, and able to support myself? Prove it, prove it, prove it.</p><p>And that&#x2019;s how I found myself back in the new building of my old company, asking for a favour. I had asked if they had proof that I had once worked there, and they told me to stop by. A bit odd. After all, I was their only design-oriented engineer back then. I set up this cultural thing, and this process thing, and had this memorable series of feature releases, including one that my kindly CEO had told me would be the sort of product he&#x2019;d remember well into his retirement. I had made an impact. Not outsized, but memorable.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t recognise the office manager and she didn&#x2019;t recognise me. I waited awkwardly to see if something could be pulled up. I looked across the open floor plan and saw no one I recognised. It was strange being at a company I once knew so well, and had helped build before the buyout, feel so distant. The office was different, the logo was different, the people were different. In a company, that&#x2019;s pretty much everything. At least when you run into an ex, they&#x2019;re roughly the same person buried in there somewhere. This wasn&#x2019;t that.</p><p>The CEO came around the corner, and I actually did recognise him from 15 years ago. Back then, he was a skinny, nervous kid intern. He had an air of impatience and arrogance. Came across back then a little rat-like, and now I felt the same rat vibes, just with more grey in his hair. And he didn&#x2019;t remember me. Not even a little bit. I tried to refer to people we had both worked with, and I saw little flickers of recognition in his face. But no, he didn&#x2019;t recall. The servers didn&#x2019;t have anything older than seven years on them. Sorry.</p><p>I threw out another few stories. Remember Doug, the old CEO? Remember when Mike sold the company and we all got half our salaries? Remember Jake? I was friends with Jake. Sorry, he said. I had clearly worked there, but he couldn&#x2019;t vouch for me.</p><p><br>New Zealand let me in anyway.</p>",2023-10-21 08:28:15,üí¨,4a17-d637

385,It‚Äôs Funny How (A Day in the Life),https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/its-funny-how-a-day-in-the-life/,"<p>It&#x2019;s funny how, when I start my weekends, I feel a little explosion of possibility, followed immediately by an avalanche of tasks. It buries me, but fortunately I have learned how to prepare myself with the right equipment to help me dig my way out. It&#x2019;s funny how productivity hacking , when it first became big thing on the internet, spawned so much attention that one of the original editors of a productivity-focused organisation actually shut it down. He mentioned, on his way out the door as he shut off the lights, that reading and writing about productivity, in the wrong contexts, can be beside the point.</p><p>It&#x2019;s funny how many people talk on the internet about how they feel about what&#x2019;s happening in the world. I get it, and I don&#x2019;t begrudge them. I spend a lot of time talking about my own predictions for the future, as I have been doing recently. But there&#x2019;s something about writing for an audience that can shift the writing. It&#x2019;s funny how a perfectly well-reasoned post for yourself, or for a small group of friends, can morph into a completely different tone when you&#x2019;re writing a Think Piece on LinkedIn. I understand the motivation, of course. Increasingly, your ability to share big, important words on the internet can lead to getting a job, which means being able to have health insurance and afford a home, which means being able to support your family and live out your dreams. It&#x2019;s funny how writing Hot Takes can directly apply to the quality of your kids&#x2019; kindergarten education, but here we are.</p><p>A few days ago I wrote the following pithy post. For context, I barely ever share on LinkedIn, so that might have helped me with the algorithm, or hurt me with the algorithm, or maybe it was neutral. (It&#x2019;s funny how we don&#x2019;t even know anymore, which in my view should remind ourselves to write for ourselves, but that sounds reckless when popular writing is what is going to indirect pay for the mortgage and the down payment on the cabin getaway in Alaska.) I wrote:<br><br>&gt; I don&apos;t mean for this to be a judgy sick burn, even if that&apos;s how it comes off. Some people on LinkedIn say &quot;AI won&apos;t take your job, but a person using AI will.&quot; Others LinkedIn are writing walls of text about how AI hype is out of control. But you know who&apos;s really going to take your job? Someone quietly working on their craft, away from LinkedIn essays.</p><p>It&#x2019;s funny how my phrasing accidentally made it seem like I&#x2019;m anti AI-hype, because a few of the responses seemed to take that tack. I left my own opinions purposely vague, because I wasn&#x2019;t talking about AI but rather how both sides writing walls of text (AI is great, AI is hype) are missing the point. Debating over what guitar is best at the pub is fine. But it&#x2019;s funny how some of the most accomplished musicians don&#x2019;t seem to get sucked into those debates as often as others.</p><p>If someone pinned me down on my opinions about the &#x201C;person with an AI taking your job&#x201D; point of view, I&#x2019;d say the quote perfectly sums up how I feel. It&#x2019;s funny that we&#x2019;re in such a pick-a-side mentality on the internet that there are seemingly three teams for anything:</p><ul><li>People whose straw man opponent is a Luddite</li><li>People whose straw man opponent is a hype beast</li><li>People whose straw man opponent is an extremist loudmouth</li></ul><p>I think that just about covers it, yes? Take NFTs: some people thought there was something there, and smirked at people who just didn&#x2019;t get it. Some people thought they were extraordinarily stupid, and resented people pushing them. And some people weren&#x2019;t content to agree or disagree, they hated the whole premise.</p><p>It&#x2019;s funny, thinking back to the school grounds when I was growing up, how you could sense what kind of people these kids would become. More than once, I&#x2019;d be in a debate with a friend and someone would chime in &#x201C;Oh my god, WHO CARES?&#x201D; For some people, that argument is airtight. For some people, people caring about a sporting event, or getting into a religious war between Mac/Windows, or having an opinion on the royal family is a tremendous waste of time and energy. So they take it amongst themselves to explain how base, how uncouth, how primitive everyone is being. I don&#x2019;t know that they see the irony. It&#x2019;s funny watching someone care very, very deeply about how people feel things too deeply.</p><p>Will AI take jobs? Of course it will. Will it change jobs? Of course it will. But that&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s so good about the line &#x201C;Someone using AI will take your job.&#x201D; There were print designers before Illustrator and Photoshop. There are print designers after Illustrator and Photoshop. But if you don&#x2019;t know those tools, it&#x2019;s highly unlikely that you&#x2019;re getting health insurance as a print designer. There are millions of engineers in the world who learned their craft before GitHub Copilot and other AI tools. There will be millions of engineers in the world (I hope) well into the future. But there will come a point, and it&#x2019;s closer than some think, where you won&#x2019;t be a working career engineer without the skills for using AI. You can tinker on code for your personal projects, but you won&#x2019;t be getting health insurance through it. It&#x2019;s funny how my certainty here makes me a hype beast. It doesn&#x2019;t take a weatherman to spot the weather.</p><p>It&#x2019;s funny how I couldn&#x2019;t write that, though. Not in that context, not with those people watching. I&#x2019;m sitting here on a Saturday, a long list of things to do, and I know the way out is through. I&#x2019;m avalanched in, but I&#x2019;m comfortable in my homemade igloo, musing about the world outside. I&#x2019;ll make my way through. No matter how it feels at the time, I always do.</p>",2024-02-23 20:27:08,üí¨,475a-6b1a

390,Backstage,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/backstage/,"<p>VH1&#x2019;s Pop Up Video helped me discover how much more interesting the background trivia can be, often more interesting than the art itself. If you look at a painting in a gallery, you&#x2019;re looking at it at the most simple level. It&#x2019;s paint. On a canvas. It&#x2019;s of a woman. She has black hair. Whereas the same painting, looked at by an art historian might know that the painting is notable for being the first time the artist experimented with mixed media. Or maybe it was the last painting the artist did before their untimely death. Or maybe the painting got them banned from the Vatican. Same painting, but now far more interesting. The art is the work, but the context provides essential flavour.</p><p>For all the time people spend rhapsodising about the beauty of the early web, you&#x2019;d think it was an infinite canvas of cool people sharing cool things, where everywhere you looked was another rabbit hole of amazing works of art to appreciate on any level you want, either superficial or at a deep craft level. I&#x2019;ve been online since the 80s, and I was one of those strange people doing internet things. With respect to my fellow greybeards, I think they&#x2019;re misremembering things, and I think they&#x2019;re ignoring how rich today&#x2019;s experience is. Today you can find an artist&#x2019;s work, support them on Patreon, follow their newsletter, chat with them on social media, find a Discord channel of like-minded people, and do it all with a simple Google login. Back then we didn&#x2019;t have micropayments, we didn&#x2019;t have person chat servers anyone could spin up with no tech background, we didn&#x2019;t have nearly infinite and nearly free internet hosting, there was no concept of single sign-on, and let&#x2019;s be honest, the art and code sucked. It sucked hard. Like, you couldn&#x2019;t resize a browser window without making Netscape Navigator 4.7 reload the entire page. If you were lucky. More often it would crash, which would crash your Mac, because Mac OS X hadn&#x2019;t come out yet. It sucked. Now is better.</p><p>But a funny thing happened with that VH1 context. On one hand, we&#x2019;ve entered into a world where most creative people think they can get by with a Link Tree. You go to artist&#x2019;s name dot com and it&#x2019;s like &#x201C;Hi. Find me on IG, Patreon, and Discord. Ok, bye.&#x201D; And that&#x2019;s their website! Obviously some people put a little more oomph into it, by putting a portfolio up, or an about page. But a lot of artists plugged into the big companies, and I don&#x2019;t blame them at all. Why bang your head against the wall with CSS/HTML if you can just use a theme? Why try to figure out how to host an email newsletter product when you can just use one? Creative people went down the list and outsourced all the boring grunt work to other companies, which was The Right Answer as far as I&#x2019;m concerned. And the tradeoff was going to be More Time You Get To Spend On Your Art, and &#x2014; you think I&#x2019;m going to say they didn&#x2019;t, but surprise! They did! &#x2014; we have never had more high quality YouTube content, high quality newsletters, high quality artists on Bandcamp, freaking everything. The artists showed up and shared their talents with the web, and we&#x2019;re all benefiting from it. LFG.</p><p>But, see, now I&#x2019;m finding my tastes shifting as a result. It&#x2019;s not hard for me to find The Best Prestige TV and The Best Illustrations I&#x2019;ve Ever Seen and The Best Indie Soundcloud Rap and so forth. I&#x2019;ve got all the glossy, polished, high quality, best thing ever, blow your socks off content, paired with the perfect social media posts and the perfect Patreon gift tiers and Reels for days. I&#x2019;ve got it, in more than enough quantity. Even the stuff that&#x2019;s not polish is Not Polished in the most perfect way, so I can pour it straight into my life with no bitter aftertaste. It&#x2019;s all operating at a really high level, even the low level stuff. Everything is aiming towards the ideal version of itself.</p><p>I want to talk about backstage stuff. Like, as a forcing function, let&#x2019;s say I died this week. I&#x2019;m an artist, and proud of it. So what would I want people to know about and see? Increasingly, I want to give people a tour of the metaphorical woodworking studio more than I want to give them perfect, I don&#x2019;t know, wood candlestick holders.</p><p>Let me be more specific. I have this long-running series of fantasy stories I&#x2019;ve done for years with my kids. There are a lot of characters involved, worlds, plots, different things I&#x2019;ve poked at through my writing. Do I want people to go read them? Eh, if they want. I think I&#x2019;d rather share <em>about</em> the work, in a non-linear way. A lot of the work doesn&#x2019;t even work in a linear, front-to-back way. Increasingly the in-canon lore is this side thing over here, or the web app I used to do this side thing, or the behind-the-scenes video for how I made it. That&#x2019;s the really fun stuff to both create and consume, from where I sit.</p><p>Or what about my made-up band, that goes on a made-up tour with made-up songs and playlists? The product itself is fine. But my impassioned explanation of why the heck anyone would do this is a lot more entertaining, in my view.</p><p>If I died this week, I&#x2019;d want to call out five of my best projects, not to get people to care about them directly, but to just be aware that they exist. Not to read them front to back, but to read the premise, maybe skim a bit of it, think &#x201C;huh, that&#x2019;s an interesting idea,&#x201D; and get on with their lives. Some people would want to dive in deeper, and they&#x2019;d discover a lot too. But all art is received at a skimming level first. Why not make the skimming level the main event? What if you wrote a song with the sole intention to make a VH1 pop up video that you knew would be more entertaining than the work itself?</p><p>I&#x2019;ve had an art show concept for about 20 years. Imagine a gallery with 10 pieces of art, each a solid colour on a small canvas. So you&#x2019;d see a canvas of red beside a canvas of blue beside a canvas of forest green. Boring, right? But then beside each lonely and low-effort piece of art would be a ten foot tall wall of text. An explainer for the art. And I&#x2019;d go out of my way to make the &#x201C;artspeak&#x201D; as impossible to read as I could. You know the style I&#x2019;m talking about. Like &#x201C;This is an exploration of the duality of man when faced with existential, postmodern dread in an ever-increasingly blah blah blah.&#x201D; You know, bullshit. It would be a gallery of bullshit art speak, and the central point of the exhibit would be to point out how banal and self important artspeak is. At least, that&#x2019;s what I used to think. I used to think it was a parody of pretentious art. I used to think that&#x2019;s what I wanted to say. But what if I reversed it?</p><p>What if, instead of making the words purposely silly, I wrote something real on those walls of text? What if, after chuckling at the simplicity of the simple squares of colour, you turned your head upwards and the writing could actually make an impact on you? What if I could find a way to help people see the beauty of the artist&#x2019;s intent when spoken clearly, apart from the artistic artefact itself? What if I could take people backstage, have a real conversation with them, person to person, that stood alone from the figurative show that happens on the stage itself? For me, the backstage chat is better than the show it&#x2019;s enabling. If I died tomorrow, I&#x2019;d want people to understand the intent more than I&#x2019;d want them scratching their heads at the simple canvases themselves.</p>",2024-03-04 19:04:10,üí¨,eea4-a96d

360,A letter to my advisor,https://academia.lot23.com/post/40,"I‚Äôm going to share a series of things on my mind this morning, and they build into a cohesive whole.<br /><br />**Banksy populism**<br /><br />One of my favourite quotes from Banksy is where he explains modern art with a radio metaphor. He says ‚Äúimagine listening to 5 minutes of static, then hearing a DJ say ‚Äòif you had read the white paper on that, you would have really enjoyed it.‚Äô That‚Äôs where modern art is today. It‚Äôs purposely opaque.‚Äù He also responded to people criticising his use of stencils and breaking other street laws by saying ‚Äúgood luck to them but I didn‚Äôt get into vandalism to be told what to do.‚Äù I relate deeply to each of these insights.<br /><br />**Pearl Jam as a metaphor**<br /><br />I recently read a fantastic memoir called Stay True that won a pulitzer. It‚Äôs about a guy born in 1977 and he got into a lot of things I did: zine writing, early internet, early 90s rock, political activism, that sort of thing. He‚Äôs a good writer and it‚Äôs fun relating to his pop culture references. In the first 50 pages, he makes fun of Pearl Jam 5 different times. I told my friend about it ‚Äî ‚Äúhe‚Äôs clearly setting up a story arc of growth with his anti-Pearl Jam obsession.‚Äù I was right. Towards the end of the book he buys ‚Äî and actually enjoys ‚Äî a Pearl Jam album. It‚Äôs used as a technique to describe personal growth.<br /><br />I used Pearl Jam the other day as a metaphor to mean ‚ÄúI am more mainstream, but I still have strong opinions and ethics.‚Äù I am fascinated by how much hate Pearl Jam gets. I am fascinated by hipster culture. I am confused why hating something is recognised as having good taste, but loving something means you have bad taste. Personally, I feel like I can see right through it: a person confident in themselves doesn‚Äôt need to shit on what other people like. Clearly hipsters have low self confidence. Is this even a debate?<br /><br />(I find it notable that designers love to talk about empathy, but step one of empathy is figuring out *why* people like Nickelback, Comic Sans, and reality tv, not just writing them all off as fucking idiots. Designers are the least empathic people I‚Äôve ever met, and I gently call them out on it here, starting at 18:24:¬†[https://interaction19.ixda.org/program/talk-abuse-and-disinformation-at-twitter-an-inside-story-jon-bell/](https://interaction19.ixda.org/program/talk-abuse-and-disinformation-at-twitter-an-inside-story-jon-bell/))<br /><br />**Proust and the Squid**<br /><br />I‚Äôve been reading Proust and the Squid, which is all about how the human brain comprehends reading. I was hoping I‚Äôd be inspired by its insights to add some more flavour and depth (and citations!) to the story arc I‚Äôve built out. I hit a jackpot with the work‚Äôs central statement: the human brain wasn‚Äôt wired to understand reading! That‚Äôs a big deal! Noam Chomsky posited/proved that oral language was hard-wired into our brains, and linguists (such as my wife) can trace all sorts of phenomena back to that central insight. If we‚Äôre wired to speak, but not to read, what does that mean? It means a lot for society and my thesis!<br /><br />**Fuck ‚Äúart speak‚Äù**<br /><br />I loathe ‚Äúart speak,‚Äù that bullshit people put beside art in galleries to make the work sound more important. For about 20 years I‚Äôve had a concept I‚Äôve wanted to put into practice, where I reverse the art and the bullshit written to the side of it. Imagine walking into a coffee shop and seeing 10 works of art as small 1x1 foot canvases. Imagine the work itself is boring, like a solid shade of blue, or a solid shade of orange. Unremarkable. But then imagine a 2 meter tall description of the work beside it, 1000 words of total bullshit, like ‚ÄúThis work explores the interconnected nature of man and our increasingly Balkanised online communities‚Ä¶‚Äù blah blah blah, spouting bullshit all the way down the page. All for a painting that clearly sucks, and clearly isn‚Äôt saying any of that. The work, of course, would be a statement on bullshit in art. How the words and contrived meaning we claim to attach to the work has overshadowed art itself.<br /><br />So you can see why Banksy‚Äôs comments speak to me. But now you‚Äôve given me an academic example to refer to! -><br /><br />**Intellectual Impostures**<br /><br />I love that someone pointed out that the Emperor (sometimes) wears no clothes. ([https://philosophynow.org/issues/25/Intellectual_Impostures_by_Sokal_and_Bricmont](https://philosophynow.org/issues/25/Intellectual_Impostures_by_Sokal_and_Bricmont)) A lot of good comes out of deep research, of course, but the idea that you can sell bullshit and get away with it is an important insight. (I bet you could get away with it at a much higher percentage than we‚Äôd be comfortable with)<br /><br />We‚Äôre used to looking at art that doesn‚Äôt move us, but feeling a social need to say it‚Äôs brilliant. We‚Äôre used to enjoying a song on the radio but being socially conditioned to call it a ‚Äúguilty pleasure,‚Äù if we admit to liking it at all. This is stupid. I did a whole talk about this and brought it to SxSW. Relevance matters. People don‚Äôt like some obscure Bad Brains song, they like Taylor Swift. And that‚Äôs ok. Ignore this reality at your own peril! ([Link to me structuring this argument](https://youtu.be/WjgpAVyE034?t=150))<br /><br />  <br /><br />**My goal when writing**<br /><br />The best compliment I get is when my writing or speaking seems clear and easy to understand. That‚Äôs all I care about, and it‚Äôs all I‚Äôm trying to do. Art speak (or academic speak) doesn‚Äôt make me think ‚Äúwow this person is smarter than me.‚Äù It makes me think ‚Äúwow this person is pretty far up their own ass.‚Äù So I spend a lot of time trying to write the perfect Brown Eyed Girl kind of pop song rather than some King Crimson epic masterwork that only 19 strange nerds can comprehend. I don‚Äôt need those 19 nerds to feel validated.<br /><br />Stephen King has a great book called On Writing, and he makes the point that writing is telepathy. He can say ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in a small room, barely big enough to fit a table. The table has a velvet tablecloth. On the table is a small vase with a single red rose.‚Äù and your brain dutifully fills in the blanks and can ‚Äúsee‚Äù the scene. That‚Äôs magic! But only if your goal is to communicate something with high fidelity to an end user.<br /><br />But if your goal isn‚Äôt that, but rather to to sound smart, and be purposely obtuse, you have to fall into art-speak bullshit. I‚Äôm not saying everyone who writes like this is *trying* to sound smart because they have an inferiority complex. Some percentage of them are just bad writers. But the end result is the same: it‚Äôs bullshit. Small insights wrapped in a tremendous amount of pretence. Wow, now exit through the gift shop.<br /><br />**Madame Bovary**<br /><br />One of the greatest moments in my education was when I read Madame Bovary in high school. The first page details a scene where an odd looking kid with an odd hat sits down in a new classroom. My teacher walked us through 4 different interpretations of the French text in an English context. The first 3 were pretty much the same. Kid, hat, classroom, he doesn‚Äôt fit in. But the fourth translation absolutely blew my socks off. There‚Äôs *so much context* buried in that one scene that no one would have any way to understand.<br /><br />I eventually realised that the words themselves, especially translated across languages, were useless. But the deeper insights found in the chunky footnotes that explained the cultural norms, allusions, wordplay, and general context? They were everything. The ‚Äúmeal‚Äù was found in the translation. The words themselves were just a delivery vehicle for the real stuff. As nurishing as a fork.<br /><br />I feel the same about Shakespeare. A good scholar can explain the genius of it, but without that kind of help you can‚Äôt understand it at all. Some of my favourite Shakespearian experiences have been where the words (fork) are on the left page and the explanation (the meal) are on the right side. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs inspired my augmented text work. We need more nourishment in our text and learning.<br /><br />**Augmented text**<br /><br />The human brain isn‚Äôt designed for reading. A lot of text isn‚Äôt designed for understanding, and is indeed purposely obfuscating its real meaning. There are more accolades for seeming edgy, obscure, opaque, niche, complicated, and easily gatekept than there are for being clear, widely accessible, and popular. Language has always been used as a means of control, from having to talk to the church to understand the bible, or having to get a law degree to understand policy/law. If National had explained its plans in plain English, instead of saying ‚Äúpeople want change,‚Äù they never would have won. There is benefit to not saying what you really mean, and leaving some wiggle room for plausible deniability. But it should be called out when it happens.<br /><br />Augmented Text, in the framing I‚Äôm working on, isn‚Äôt meant as a neat multimedia trick where you can pack more value into traditional text-based text. It‚Äôs about speaking more clearly, to more people, more of the time. More people should feel the way I did when someone could explain Madame Bovary to me, or the time I understood why compound interest is one of the most powerful forces in the world. More people should be taught clearly, by people with a vested interest in helping them to learn. The clearer, the better. Always.",2023-12-21 22:55:24,üéì,b3f8-fdf7
355,This Chance,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/this-chance/,"<p>There&#x2019;s a simple line from a TOOL song that always grabs me:</p><blockquote>Celebrate this chance to be alive and breathing</blockquote><p>That&#x2019;s it! There&#x2019;s no deeper metaphor, there&#x2019;s no double meaning. It&#x2019;s as basic as reminder as you&#x2019;ll ever get about living well. Remembering that you get to live right now, something that a lot of people no longer have, and that it&#x2019;s a blessing. You can appreciate things on this level without being religious or sappy, take it from me.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve often been puzzled by people asking big questions of life like &#x201C;is this all there is?&#x201D; The answer, as always, has been yes. If your entire life is watching YouTube videos and begrudgingly going to work 9-5, then that&#x2019;s all there is. On the other hand, someone who decides they&#x2019;re going to scale three mountains in a summer, volunteer at the local hospital, or write a book has given themselves a different version of &#x201C;all that is.&#x201D; There are an infinite number of things to go pursue, so if you&#x2019;re not happy with the ones you&#x2019;ve selected, that doesn&#x2019;t mean there aren&#x2019;t options. It just means you need to pick something better. This is not a deep riddle or mystery. And yet. And yet. Hold that thought.</p><p>I was once bellyaching to another creative friend about how artists are too sensitive. She explained why with both patience and confusion. Like teaching a child why they can&#x2019;t draw on the wall of the kitchen, this was basic knowledge to her that she realised she&#x2019;d have to pass on to me, so she walked me through it. &#x201C;Jon, artists have a wider aperture, like in a camera. We let absolutely everything in. We see everything, because that&#x2019;s what it means to be an artist. The problem with seeing everything is that every little thing sneaks in, including criticisms and self doubts.&#x201D; Well! That about sums it up, and I don&#x2019;t have to think about that anymore. It&#x2019;s nice when someone&#x2019;s done the thinking for me! Hold that thought.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve been thinking about what would happen if I tried to start a business from scratch. I&#x2019;ve always appreciated the stability of corporate jobs, or at least startups where I&#x2019;m not the CEO. I often tell people how I don&#x2019;t understand the entrepreneurial instinct &#x2014; why would someone threaten the stability of their family by leveraging their home for a bank loan? I don&#x2019;t care how good your vision is, most companies fail and then you owe a ton of money. Yuck! On the other hand, I did found a non-profit a few years back, and I loved it for a few months before another job came calling. It&#x2019;s also worth pointing out that not every company needs to make gobs of money, or be a for-profit at all. They don&#x2019;t need a big staff, and the product doesn&#x2019;t even need to include software. Shocking, I know. Hold that thought.</p><p>When I was growing up, autism was a word used for people who had special needs at school. For example, people who were non-verbal or who needed physical assistance in a typical classroom environment. But as time went on, &#x201C;neurodiversity&#x201D; emerged as a much broader umbrella term, not just for people with visibly apparent differences, but people we my have traditionally called &#x201C;quirky&#x201D; or &#x201C;hyper-focused&#x201D; or &#x201C;socially awkward&#x201D; or even just &#x201C;super bright.&#x201D; There&#x2019;s a reason people talk about &#x201C;the spectrum&#x201D; &#x2014; it covers a tremendous amount of ground. And it&#x2019;s been dawning on me that, hold on a second, I may be autistic. Just like David Byrne! If I am, it&#x2019;d make a lot of sense. And when I mention this to my neurodivergent friends, it&#x2019;s been notable that everyone just smiles serenely at me. Their face says it all. &#x201C;Yup. Welcome.&#x201D; Hold that thought.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve been writing my thesis and I&#x2019;m making real progress. I don&#x2019;t want to sugarcoat it. It&#x2019;s been hard, and I&#x2019;ve been flailing for the last month or so. I&#x2019;ve been realising I don&#x2019;t have time to do everything I want, I&#x2019;ve been stressed about getting everything done, and I&#x2019;ve definitely experienced that saggy part in the middle of a giant project where you&#x2019;re a bit lost. So all of those things have happened to me for sure. But, on the flip side, I have indeed made progress. I don&#x2019;t mean to toot my own horn, but when I&#x2019;m done freaking out about a project&#x2019;s schedule, I tend to be good at cutting it back, coming up with a plan, and doing it. I hate not having a plan so I&#x2019;m pretty good at making plans. Hold that thought.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve dialled up how much time I spend with my kids. I work from home, so we&#x2019;re already on top of each other most of the day, seven days a week. They are definitely getting a lot of dad face time, even when I&#x2019;m buried in work. That said, there&#x2019;s been a notable uptick lately. A few weeks ago I took one of my daughters out one on one, and later she called it &#x201C;the best day ever.&#x201D; Then I did the same with my other daughter and got similarly glowing reviews. Then we went out together and brought a friend the following weekend, and it was amazing all over again. I&#x2019;ve always done these sorts of techniques &#x2014; having twins has given me strong opinions, one of which is that you need to spend one on one time with kids, not just always clump them together as &#x201C;twins&#x201D; &#x2014; but I&#x2019;ve put more emphasis on it lately, and I&#x2019;ve seen the results. It turns out working on things makes them better. Having a plan matters. Hold that thought.</p><p>I have so many things going on. I&#x2019;m tired and focused. I&#x2019;m distracted and excited. I&#x2019;m doing more of what I want, and less of what I don&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m lost and know exactly where I&#x2019;m going. I have a map and the lines are dancing. I feel everything, from the pain of my recent wisdom teeth removal and concussion that sent me to the doctor, to feeling the blessing of being here, alive and breathing. I hold each of these thoughts and so many more.</p>",2023-12-15 20:52:49,üí¨,3ad1-0d5b
265,Closing Down,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/closing-down/,"<p>I just read someone say this on their blog:<br></p><blockquote>Some of these would make pretty good Midjourney prompts but I will leave that as an exercise to the reader. (Mostly because I&apos;ve never had the patience to figure out the Rube Goldbergian process for using Midjourney. Step 1: sign up for an account on a gamers chat app??! No thank you.)</blockquote><p>And it reminded me of the opposite attitude, told to me by someone I look up to, the dad of my friend.</p><blockquote>The best advice I have for aging is to try to remember to keep saying yes. If someone asks me to a Bob Dylan show, I&#x2019;m going to go. But if someone tells me about Kendrick Lamar, there&#x2019;s a temptation to say no. But I try to push back against that, and try to keep saying yes to things.</blockquote><p>When I watch my kids at school, they&#x2019;re on the good side of this spectrum. The world is offering up lots of different things to do and learn, and you can see their mind expanding as a result. It&#x2019;s encouraging and inspiring.</p><p>But refusing to try a new tool because you don&#x2019;t want to sign up for it? Come on. We all have to make decisions about where to spend time, and one of the joys of aging is realising what isn&#x2019;t worth your time. But I think it&#x2019;s a double-sided sword. You can be so selective with your time and effort that you forget how to be surprised or impressed. And hey, that&#x2019;s fine. Use your energy where you see fit.</p><p>Just saying, from where I sit, you&#x2019;re not going to be very fun in conversation.</p>",2023-06-18 20:20:46,üí¨,d503-6d42
274,I‚Äôm not so sure about Vision OS Simulator,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/im-not-so-sure-about-vision-os-simulator/,"<p>I am bouncing-off-the-walls excited about Apple Vision Pro. I&#x2019;m most excited about the opportunity to use the device to have multiple screens. I want to put my todo list on the wall beside me. I want to put a concert video on the wall in the corner as if I had a big TV. I want to have an infinite Figma canvas to play in. I&#x2019;ve even started fooling around with Swift and 3D rendering again so maybe I can make some simple apps. I have plenty of ideas of web experiments I&#x2019;d love to move into native code.</p><p>When I first launched the Vision OS Simulator, I was blown away by how smooth and impressive it was. Xcode has iterated a lot over the years, and I&#x2019;m impressed by how much power it has while still feeling simpler and more straight-forward than other IDEs. Good for Apple! But then I struggled to get the Simulator to do things, so I gave up. Bugs are normal, that&#x2019;s fine.</p><p>Then I saw a video of someone else getting the Simulator to do things I couldn&#x2019;t do. For example, you can move windows around on the screen but only when you&#x2019;re in the right mode. I was apparently in the wrong mode when I first tried, so I booted it back up again. Much better! Except &#x2026;</p><p>The only thing I want to do is take a window and &#x201C;hang&#x201D; it on the wall like a painting. But I cannot figure out how to move things forward and backward on a Z axis. So I have a living room littered with a bunch of windows at strange angles, and nothing hanging nicely on the wall. It&#x2019;s aggravating.</p><p>This doesn&#x2019;t mean the headset itself will have the same problem. I assume moving forward and backward in space is going to be pretty intuitive when you&#x2019;re controlling with your fingers, Minority Report-style. But gosh, the thing I&#x2019;m most excited about trying in the Simulator won&#x2019;t work and it&#x2019;s making me less excited.</p>",2023-06-23 05:51:34,üí¨,18f5-f9f0
68,How Infinity Works,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/how-infinity-works/,"<p>Or, how I understand infinity to work, as a person who isn&#x2019;t particularly knowledgeable about science.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve read some books, most recently The Mathematical Universe, and come to think of it, I did watch a Netflix documentary about infinity once. But my key assertions &#x2013; or at least the things I believe to be true &#x2013; are just some guy thinking about it. I am not an expert, as I&#x2019;m sure the following paragraphs will make clear.</p><p>I think a lot of people struggle with the concept of infinity because they think it means &#x201C;a really big number.&#x201D; But it means something closer to &#x201C;everything.&#x201D; The difference between &#x201C;a really big number&#x201D; and &#x201C;everything&#x201D; is, well, everything. So when people talk about infinite universes, they&#x2019;re not saying &#x201C;a vast number of universes that are always expanding.&#x201D; They&#x2019;re saying &#x201C;if it can exist, it does.&#x201D; Which is mind boggling.</p><p>Multiverse theory has never sat well with me, placing me in good company. Everyone, whether they agree with the theory or not, starts from a place of &#x201C;huh? How could that be true?&#x201D; Max Tegmark describes how physicists sometimes move from &#x201C;I hate it and it&#x2019;s wrong&#x201D; to &#x201C;I hate it.&#x201D; So I&#x2019;m hardly alone in thinking the theory sounds insane. The only difference between me and really smart physicists is that they&#x2019;ve done enough research to truly hate it, whereas I&#x2019;m just a normie struggling to understand the basics.</p><p>All of which to say, I&#x2019;m not claiming I&#x2019;m right or have any unique insight into the question, just that I&#x2019;m as befuddled as you&#x2019;re supposed to be when you start thinking about this. So let&#x2019;s talk about infinity in the context of multiverse theory, and what &#x201C;everything&#x201D; has to mean.</p><p>Is it possible that there&#x2019;s a universe where you&#x2019;re exactly the same as you are right now, but in five minutes you just randomly sprout a tail? Even if this has never happened to anyone on earth, ever? Well, probably not. We&#x2019;re still bound to the laws of nature, and the idea that a person would spontaneously just get a tail isn&#x2019;t something we&#x2019;ve seen before. So that universe almost certainly doesn&#x2019;t exist because it bumps up against the laws of nature and physics.</p><p>I was talking to a friend yesterday about universes where I am married to a frog or Barack Obama. Are those possible, even if the chances are very very low? Of course, because very very low is not the same as impossible. Just like very very big is not the same as infinite. Multiverse theory and infinity &#x2013; according to my lightly educated understanding of them &#x2013; claims that everything that can be possible is possible. Marrying a frog or Barack Obama are extremely unlikely, not impossible, which means it exists. On the other hand, 1+1=3 will never be true, anywhere, under any circumstances.</p><p>That&#x2019;s how I understand it, anyway. I could be wrong. Or the theory could be!</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>Fun side note: in 2006 or 2007 I was invited to meet the junior senator from Illinois for a small brunch gathering in Seattle. I could have gone, but I assumed he had no chance at the presidency so I passed. But multiverse theory tells me that other versions of Jon Bell met Senator Barack Obama that day. It tells me that of all the versions of myself, some ended up striking up a conversation with him. Of those, some subset made an impression on him, and yes, some subset made such an impression that we became friends. Extrapolate from there.</p><p>The difference between verrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry unlikely and impossible is where infinity asserts itself. Do I honestly think there&#x2019;s a version of me somewhere in the multiverses who is happily married to Barack Obama? Well, no. But some versions of multiverse theory claim that until I can explain why it&#x2019;s breaking the laws of physics, that reality does exist out there somewhere in the tapestry of infinity. Kind of strange, but I am sure &#x2013; and I can admit &#x2013; the chances of that reality existing cannot be zero.</p>",2023-02-13 19:21:06,üí¨,de7b-0562
365,The Crushing Weight,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/the-crushing-weight/,"<p>I feel better when I have a place to put my thoughts. You can think of it in a very objective, analytical way, like counting steps. If you&#x2019;re 15 steps away from something, that&#x2019;s further than 5 steps. If you have to open 3 doors to get to a certain room in your house, that&#x2019;s harder than 1 door. And when it comes to writing, I want there to be as little space as possible between inspiration, creating something, and being done.</p><p>I employ all sorts of tricks for this. I try to work on projects with a finite end date so they don&#x2019;t stall out. I try to avoid what Ze Frank calls &#x201C;brain crack&#x201D; by getting things out into the world as quickly as possible. Even if the quality won&#x2019;t be high. I try to tell myself &#x201C;the best you can is good enough.&#x201D; I remind myself that I can never watch everything, read everything, or go everywhere, so the best thing to do is pick and then appreciate. I do not relate to people who spend time finding just the right restaurant, only to wait in line with all the other min-maxxers. Give me a hole in the wall. Maybe the food&#x2019;s not good. Fine. I don&#x2019;t mind. Let&#x2019;s go summarises my own approach to most things. Not because I&#x2019;m in a hurry reach a destination but because I enjoy the feeling of movement. Even if it&#x2019;s in the wrong direction. Even if I have to backtrack. Go!</p><p>Recently my creative processes have been weighing down on me. I have a lot of blogs &#x2014; &#x201C;ah ha!&#x201D; you may be thinking. &#x201C;You have too many blogs, you should reduce them and reap the benefits!&#x201D; Actually, it&#x2019;s the opposite, hold that thought &#x2014; but recently I&#x2019;ve not been able to categorise my writing, so I get paralysed. Perhaps some examples will help. I have a blog for getting better at cooking, and this general blog. But if I want to excitedly talk about a new project, I don&#x2019;t have a dedicated place for that, and I don&#x2019;t want to pollute this blog. And so I sit on it. And the energy curdles. It&#x2019;s too many steps, so it&#x2019;s not as fresh.</p><p>I think I&#x2019;m going to start yet another blog, which is probably number 10 or 15 or so. I&#x2019;ve been combining them all into my Firehose, a project I&#x2019;ve quite enjoyed working on for the last year or so. I wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised if I ended up with 50 blogs, which sounds crazy. Shouldn&#x2019;t I just mix my visual blog product with my thesis with my photo gallery with my projects with my medium.com blog with everything else? No. Because when I do that I write less.</p><p><br>So 50 blogs it is. I&#x2019;d rather have one step to 50 blogs than 50 steps to 1.</p>",2024-01-11 05:08:23,üí¨,a945-fe4a
392,My Morning MP3,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/my-morning-mp3/,"<p>I have a rough idea for a product I want to build for myself, and I already have several of the pieces of technology to make it work. But I&#x2019;m not sure exactly what to build, so I&#x2019;m going to think out loud while I work it out.</p><p>The goal is to have an MP3 of something to listen to in the morning. Why? Mostly because I think it&#x2019;d be cool, which is a terribly reason to work on something. Secondarily because I want to learn the skills for doing it, which is fine for teaching yourself, but the result isn&#x2019;t necessarily something anyone would actually need or use. So I should purely in the mindset of designing a thing for one person, me. To see what happens.</p><p>So if I were to wake up in the morning and load up an MP3 while I walked my dog, what would I want to hear?</p><p>One idea is to make some sort of chatGPT radio show. I could imagine a series of segments, some topical and some not. It could connect to my calendar to see what I have on that day. I could see connecting to my todo list. Scraping the latest news stories. Maybe some things could be more creative, like little two minute stories. Maybe it could pull down some new music from somewhere.</p><p>There are summarisation APIs now, where I can point to anything &#x2014; Podcast, YouTube clip, webpage &#x2014; and it will summarise it for me. I could imagine pulling from some interesting sources to summarise things while I walk. That could be interesting.</p><p>But maybe I&#x2019;m barking up the wrong tree. Maybe these are a few tech demos.</p><ul><li>I want to learn how to translate words into an MP3</li><li>I want to learn how to summarise with Kagi&#x2019;s universal summariser</li><li>I want to learn how to get chatGPT to talk to an external source</li></ul><p>So I don&#x2019;t think I have a product yet, even for an audience of one.

388,"It's 2 March, and things look good",https://academia.lot23.com/post/45,"In my last update, I teed up a few things:<br /><br />1. I was about to chat with Walter<br />2. I needed to group my comparative studies<br />3. I needed to call out references<br /><br />The chat with Walter went great. He's saying my work is really close, my number of references are good, and my writing style is good. This was important for me to hear. Remember, this is all new to me! I could have submitted a thing and gotten feedback that my writing style is too basic, or I'm missing a whole chunk, or something troubling like that. Instead he told me to stay the course. Land the plane.<br /><br />(I've been labelling my drafts LTP-1, LTP-2, etc for ""Land the Plane."" Right now I'm up to LTP-5.)<br /><br />I grouped my comparative studies, I stubbed out my references, I got feedback from Walter that I'm headed in the right place, so now I just need to actually keep heading in that direction! Tangibly, here are my notes to myself to keep me focused and driving forward.<br /><br />First, I need to write this journal to get my thoughts in order. Done!<br /><br />Next, I need to export my latest thesis, plus my todo list, plus this journal entry, to my customGPT. With this software brain, I can say things like ""what am I doing next?"" or ""what themes are a bit light?"" or whatever. It's the best research assistant there is, but first you have to train it! Pretty simple to do: I just save a bunch of files, put it into the brain, then ask basic questions. For fun, I'll put a question here. Q: What color is augmented text? A: It has no color, but for the sake of testing the system, let's say it's a purple and yellow diagonal striped pattern.<br /><br />Once I do those two tasks, it's time to get down to brass tacks and do the work. Here's approach I think will work best.<br /><br />1. Fix the Conclusion/future work stuff, then add an appendix and put the boring data in there<br />2. Add a simple table of contents -- it doesn't need to be detailed yet<br />3. Add in all the references I have (in the body)<br />4. I need a better transition from the Introduction to the next section. Right now it's abrupt.<br />5. Update OmniFocus to ""bucket"" the tasks I need to do, in which order<br />6. Write the references section at the end (see #3)<br /><br />Remember that the overall mindset is: land the plane! I don't need to add more things right now. I need to tighten up what I have, as if it were due tomorrow. If I were to add references, improve the introduction, add a TOC, and make a better structured conclusion/appendix, that'd be pretty good.<br /><br />Are there other things to add? Sure, tons. But those are the basics. Let's go!<br /><br />",2024-03-01 20:01:04,üéì,d133-41a6

The internet is full of people giving credit to Brendan Fraser&#x2019;s performance but wondering why the writing is so ham-fisted. It turns out the reason is simple: it&#x2019;s adapted from a play, and the movie tried to stay true to the original screenplay.</p><p>As a result you get one set, with Brandan Fraser occupying the centre of it and various characters coming in with tick-tock regularity to opine about the world in long, unrealistic monologues. If I had seen this setup at my local theatre, it would make sense. But seeing it in a movie, a medium that benefits from realism and realised worlds outside the walls of a set, feels off.</p><p>So congratulations to Brendan Fraser and everyone for doing the best they could with the inelegant material. It&#x2019;s a good movie. But it was a better play.</p>",2023-07-13 21:15:39,üí¨,383e-b27d
302,Building a personal agent (again),https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/building-a-personal-agent-again/,"<p>I&apos;ve wanted to filter the internet for a really long time. I even started a non-profit in 2020 called Arbiter to help me think about how to do it, and how to make the idea into a product. This is not a new idea, of course. Every time you use an ad blocker or change the default font on your browser, you&apos;re doing this at a small scale. But after working at Twitter, I got a bee in my bonnet. I wanted to figure out a way to give people control over what they consume online.</p><p>I just did some digging and found several weeks of work I did three years ago. There are lots of screens, including a completed design for an iPhone app. There are multiple videos where I pitched the concept with a compelling story arc. The old work shows the idea getting built, brick by brick, and I think the app could be helpful if I were to build it as I described. But a lot has happened in the last three years, and I&#x2019;m revisiting some of the assumptions. I&#x2019;m dreaming up something new. Same concept, different execution.</p><p>My previous explorations assumed an RSS Reader/newsfeed sort of approach. You&#x2019;d point to your news sources, describe what you wanted to see more and less of, and the product would deliver it. In the end, it would be Google Reader with a filter option. Which is fine. But it still requires a lot of work. It&#x2019;s still a 1:1 relationship with each article bombarding you in your timeline, which is still too much. Instead of going 1:1, the agent needs to pop up a level. Let me explain.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s say there are 30 articles on the political news aggregator Memorandum right now. Let&#x2019;s say 16 of them are about Biden or Trump directly, 5 of them are about Ukraine, and the rest are a hodgepodge of stories that aren&#x2019;t as significant. One approach is to show all 30 stories with tags and metadata. The other approach is to summarise the 30 into a few bulletpoints. My old approach was the former, but I&#x2019;m now convinced I should be doing the latter.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>This morning I wrote up a simple bit of code. All it does is:</p><ol><li>Visit memeorandum</li><li>Pull out the headlines</li><li>Use chatGPT to summarise them into bulletpoints</li></ol><p>It does so little that it&#x2019;s almost not worth mentioning. And yet the experience gains are pretty tremendous considering how trivial it sounds. On the current site, I can only read about five headlines before needing to scroll, which are:</p><ul><li>Inside Biden&#x2019;s unusual hidden campaign</li><li>Biden looks to put North Carolina on &#x2019;24 map</li><li>Before Jan 6, Mark Meadows joked about Trump&#x2019;s election claims</li><li>DOJ special contacts Kemp, former Arizona governmor in Jan 6 probe: reports</li><li>San Diego library protest against pride books draws a backlash</li></ul><p>Pretty standard political news stuff. But the reason I can only see the top five is that each headline is adorned with a bunch of other content like links to people tweeting about the news. But with my script, I can fit the entire news day, with more information and less cruft, in the same space. It looks like this:</p><ul><li>President Biden is relying on Democratic and outside groups for his reelection campaign, rather than a centralized effort.</li><li>Biden is targeting North Carolina in the 2024 election, as Democrats believe Republicans cannot win the White House without it.</li><li>Mark Meadows, former chief of staff to Donald Trump, made jokes about Trump&apos;s baseless claims of voter fraud.</li><li>Georgia Governor Brian Kemp has been contacted by the special counsel investigating Trump&apos;s attempts to overturn the 2020 election.</li><li>A protest against LGBTQ books in a San Diego library has sparked backlash.</li><li>New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu believes Republican presidential contenders can defeat Trump if they challenge him directly.</li><li>Three of Trump&apos;s potential rivals for the 2024 GOP nomination are proposing cuts to Social Security for younger people.</li><li>Republicans are criticizing Biden&apos;s handling of crime, immigration, and inflation, but face challenges in their arguments.</li><li>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has faced criticism for his changing stance on vaccines and new standards for Black history education.</li><li>Biden&apos;s economic policies have resulted in stronger GDP growth, according to Morgan Stanley.</li></ul><p>Some of these summaries sound about the same (such as the LGBTQ books backlash) but in some cases my summary is way more informative. For example, &#x201C;Inside Biden&#x2019;s unusual hidden campaign&#x201D; doesn&#x2019;t tell us much other than the fact that it&#x2019;s unusual and hidden. But my rewrite gets at the actual story, that he is relying on outside groups rather than a centralised effort. That&#x2019;s a strategic decision, with clear tradeoffs, which is a notable news story! But you wouldn&#x2019;t know it from the original &#x201C;unusual, hidden&#x201D; headline.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>I&#x2019;m also thinking about the &#x201C;job to be done&#x201D; when it comes to political news. A lot of people, including me, aren&#x2019;t checking political news to be informed citizens. It&#x2019;s a way to procrastinate. It&#x2019;s a way to cheer on your political sports team, and a way to work through your anxiety about the future of democracy. When you&#x2019;re designing a product, you need to understand the product people think they&#x2019;re buying (jeans) versus the product they&#x2019;re actually buying (belonging, showing off your taste/wealth, sex appeal). If you focus too much on the literal product, and not on the job people are hiring the product for, you won&#x2019;t get very far. There&#x2019;s a joke that engineers would have named KFC &#x201C;Dead Hot Birds&#x201D; if they were asked to name it, but KFC goes well beyond that. The same will be true with this product.</p><p>So let&#x2019;s say it used to take 5 minutes to catch up on the news, but my script can help people catch up in 1 minute. That&#x2019;s a huge gain if people are trying to save time. But what if they&#x2019;re actively trying to procrastinate and waste time? Then 5 minutes turning to 1 might actually be a pretty lousy experience. Or what about how my summaries are making the news more boring? That&#x2019;s great if you&#x2019;re looking for neutral news like I am. But what if you&#x2019;re looking for cheerleader-style news that tells you how right you are and how evil the other side is? By that metric, my product would be a failure.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>When I reach this sort of place with my product ideas, I know I&#x2019;m at a good place to build a personal prototype. I can&#x2019;t think about what other people would want, because I don&#x2019;t even know what I want yet! The beset way to know is to build something quickly, try it out, and see what resonates. So here&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m going to build:</p><ul><li>Every 15 minutes, a script will pull new headlines from memeorandum</li><li>When I load my product, it will use chatGPT to summarise and display the headlines.</li></ul><p><br>Then I&#x2019;ll use it for a while and iterate from there. Fun!</p>",2023-07-23 02:20:22,üí¨,0a45-e14f

357,Can I Talk About This Yet?,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/can-i-talk-about-this-yet/,"<p>A long time ago, maybe five or ten years, I started a project called Can I Talk About This Yet? It was broken into different folders representing the different companies I&#x2019;ve worked at, with little essays inside each. Some weren&#x2019;t fleshed out yet, and just had little notes at the top, like &#x201C;Talk about getting promoted to the third floor of RealNetworks.&#x201D;</p><p>I&#x2019;ve also worked on different memoir approaches over the years. I have one called Beeping Lights, which strictly tells my story through technology. The premise for that one is that I don&#x2019;t think anyone cares what year or what hospital I was born in. I don&#x2019;t think anyone cares what my parents or grandparents did for a living. Let&#x2019;s be honest, no one really cares very much about me specifically. I&#x2019;m not a celebrity or a notable figure, so writing a traditional memoir wouldn&#x2019;t really make sense. But on the other hand, some of the best memoirs I&#x2019;ve ever read weren&#x2019;t great because the person was great, but because the writing was so personal. I figured I could write a thing or two about how I experienced technology, and how it felt for me. That could work, maybe.</p><p>I&#x2019;m reading Stay True right now, a memoir by Hua Hsu. It&#x2019;s quite good, and as a bonus he&#x2019;s a similar age to me so I get all of his pop culture references. The conversations he&#x2019;s describing are often the same conversations I was having with my friends on the other side of the country. I feel like I get him, and if he met me, he&#x2019;d get me. So I considered a thought exercise, after watching a video of an interview where someone asked him when he thought he was ready to write this book. He said &#x201C;that&#x2019;s a really great, question, actually&#x201D; and before he could answer I asked myself the same thing. Am I ready to write? And what would my angle be?</p><p>I was once taught that if you&#x2019;re in doubt, bet on the truth. And if you&#x2019;re still in doubt, bet on more truth. Fine. Here&#x2019;s mine. On one hand, I was just happy to have a job at all. When I made it to RealNetworks in 2000 I couldn&#x2019;t believe I had a job before even graduating college. Later that year I dropped out, and even after I got my degree I always found myself looking over my shoulder. I always felt grateful to have a job. So that was a big part of my work persona for many years. I once did a Show and Tell presentation on the Windows Phone design team, and I returned to the theme of &#x201C;Just Happy to Be Here.&#x201D;<br><br>On the other hand, and I&#x2019;m just trying to be honest here, I was really good at my job. Not better than anyone, but at the same time I was above it all. People have told me as much since then, that it looks like I float through my jobs like I&#x2019;m above it all. I was fortunate enough for people to greet me with open arms even when I went to competitive jobs. I caused a bit of a stir when I joined Windows Phone. The same happened when I went to Twitter. I&#x2019;m not meaning to humble brag, but to this day I&#x2019;m not sure what they were responding to. I just knew I wasn&#x2019;t like them. My incentives were different, my background was strange, and as time went on I was older than the others. I didn&#x2019;t quite fit in and that usually suited me.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve been reluctant to continue these projects because I don&#x2019;t want to sound prideful or boring. I have considered trying to turn the experiences into a Dave Barry-style madcap bit of comedy writing, but I don&#x2019;t know if I can pull it off. I&#x2019;ve considered it being very tell-all, but I wonder if that will be career-limiting or rude. I don&#x2019;t know what I&#x2019;ll end up doing, but I&#x2019;m just trying to bet on the truth. I was never supposed to have a career, or even make it this far. On the other hand, I was above it all. I looked up to so many people but also found everything petty and small. Too money driven. Too achievement oriented. Everyone had their heads on backwards, and seemed not to understand how amazing their lives were, if they could just stop and notice it.</p><p>I was grateful, and so over it. That&#x2019;s how I approached tech. It paid well, it opened doors, and it was all so much bullshit. I learned about myself that I am totally fine with bullshit if it means I can support my family. But I also learned you&#x2019;re not supposed to say that part out loud.</p>",2023-12-18 09:24:14,üí¨,af60-697a

305,How life looks right about now,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/how-life-looks-right-about-now/,"<p>My wrist has been hurting for several months. First I blamed it on a particularly thunderous shot on goal that I was barely able to dampen with my doomed outstretched hands. I watched the shot come, too. Not just because he launched the ball from the mid-point of a futsol court, but because before his shot he stopped the ball, squared his hips, stared at me, and marshalled all his energy like some anime character. I blocked the shot, somehow, but my wrist hasn&#x2019;t stopped hurting since.</p><p>As the weeks wore on, another theory asserted itself. Maybe it&#x2019;s carpal tunnel syndrome? I work on my laptop all day, and my series of home perches aren&#x2019;t particularly ergonomic. I&#x2019;ve got the couch I&#x2019;m slumped into now, which makes every effort to curve your body like a YCMA or Sesame Street character trying to form the letter C. I&#x2019;ve got my bed, which, as you might have gathered from the name, is a bed. And then there&#x2019;s my new office, which is less an office than a broomcloset with speakers. The desk in there was meant for the dump &#x2013; which New Zealanders call the &#x201C;tip&#x201D; &#x2014; but I determined that a ramshackle, too-short desk was better than nothing, and now my wrists and back are telling me that I was very wrong indeed.</p><p>I&#x2019;m in this glorified spider hole with wifi because my family has reoriented the house. I won&#x2019;t bore you exactly with which kid moved into which room and why, but suffice it to say that in the forest three paths diverged, and I, ow, I took the most painful one. The things we do for our kids. The things we do for our kids that they studiously do not even notice. You&#x2019;ll thank me one day, kids! Except they won&#x2019;t. And if I raise my arm to holler at them, it will hurt.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve been solo-parenting for a few weeks, and I have a few weeks to go. My blog posts aren&#x2019;t being posted correctly to my server, so I should fix that. (In fact, if you&#x2019;re reading this, it&#x2019;s possible &#x2014; but falling short of &#x201C;likely&#x201D; &#x2014; that I did fix it.

340,The Next Level of Creativity,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/the-next-level-of-creativity/,"<p>Many years ago, Brian Eno came up with a deck of cards called &#x201C;Oblique Strategies.&#x201D; Each card had a provocative statement on it. Examples:</p><ul><li>Is there something missing?</li><li>Work at a different speed</li><li>Use an unacceptable color</li></ul><p>The idea was to hit a creative roadblock, draw a card, and hopefully it would be enough to inspire your creative mind into action. Brian Eno and many other artists have famously used these cards and techniques like it time and time again.</p><p>About 15 years ago, I discovered a book called Lateral Thinking, which talked about similar things. When you&#x2019;re thinking in a black and white way, where one step leads to the next step in a process, it can be easy to get in a rut simply by throwing a curveball, like:</p><ul><li>How would this product be used in a zombie apocalypse?</li><li>What would Jay-Z do?</li><li>How can we make the absolute worst version of this?</li></ul><p>The same process in your brain kicks in. Rather than thinking about the obvious next step, you&#x2019;re now layering in something new, which drives creativity. And one of the most beautiful things I&#x2019;ve learned about this technique is that the breakthroughs don&#x2019;t end up mattering for the edgecases like zombie apocalypses, Jay-Z alignment, or bad versions of products. They end up directly relating to the project itself, even if it takes a bit of outside-the-box thinking to get there.</p><p>Much of my career has centred around these sorts of techniques. I have a collection that I can use in different situations to get different results. I&#x2019;ve taught classes using them, I&#x2019;ve driven my own teams to be more creative, and I&#x2019;ve written lots of articles, which have led to lots of books. This is how I stand out in a crowded field, so I&#x2019;m always on the hunt for more of these techniques. Which is what is so exciting to me about chatGPT, and why I think so many people are missing the boat.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>Today I was at a restaurant with my two 11-year old daughters and their friend. I asked if they wanted to play a game of D&amp;D while we waited for our food. Already, that&#x2019;s a pretty fun idea. I can think of many times in my life where I just sat, waiting for food, and if I hadn&#x2019;t brought a book I&#x2019;d just read the menu for entertainment. I would have loved it if the adults in my life were fun enough to have spun up a random game of D&amp;D a time or two.</p><p>I could have run the game on my own, of course. I could have asked each girl what sort of adventurer they wanted to be, then I could have presented a scenario to them to react to. I&#x2019;ve been a dungeon master (DM) before, and it&#x2019;s tough! You need to be able to think on your feet while you build the story around the decisions each person makes. It&#x2019;s possible, but it&#x2019;s not easy. I&#x2019;d say most people aren&#x2019;t well-suited to it without some amount of practice.</p><p>But with chatGPT, I could go to the next level of creativity. Rather than coming up with the name of the village, the nature of the threat, and the vibe of the adventure, I could offload that to the AI and think at a higher level. I said something like this:</p><blockquote>Hey, I have three 11 year old girls waiting for their food and we want to play a quick game of D&amp;D. Please come up with an enjoyable adventure so they can all play together. Start by asking each of them one by one about their character, perhaps giving them multiple choice answers to choose from.</blockquote><p>And away we went. For the next 30 minutes we suited up, addressed a threat, made decisions, and had a whale of a time. At the end, I even asked for a keepsake image of the adventurers and the large giant they befriended, who happened to look a lot like a dragon crossed with Ed Sheeran. (You had to be there) It was a truly magical experience. But I want to analyse why, because this is important. Let&#x2019;s look at the guidance I gave chatGPT, and why it represents next level creativity.</p><ol><li>3 people (create the characters)</li><li>11 years old (make it kid-friendly)</li><li>Waiting on food (make it quick)</li><li>Enjoyable + play together (rather than earnest and solo)</li><li>Start by asking each one (to keep everyone engaged)</li><li>Give them multiple choices (to avoid writer&#x2019;s block)</li></ol><p>I could have gone a different way, like:</p><blockquote>chatGPT, tell me a joke</blockquote><p>Or even if I knew I wanted to play D&amp;D, I could have just said:</p><blockquote>chatGPT, set up a game of D&amp;D for three people.</blockquote><p>But neither one would have hit the same quality bar that I was able to achieve. This is why I am surprised and a bit bemused when people make jokes about &#x201C;pressing the creativity button&#x201D; when writing off the potential of generative AI. When you strum a guitar, there are hundreds or thousands of different techniques you can employ. A poorly done strum sounds pretty much the same no matter who does it. But someone good at the guitar can make art, and the very best guitarists somehow find a way to channel themselves into it in a way where they sound like no one else. The same is true with effects, pedals, and music production techniques. Anyone can press an auto-tune button. But some producers are able to take the millions of different creative options and form them into something transcendent. Such is the case with generative AI.</p><p>Think back to 100 different restaurant visits over your lifetime, each with their own waiting time for the food. Imagine ranking each experience on a bell curve from forgettable to memorable, or from boring to awesome. For me, today&#x2019;s experience might not have been the best I&#x2019;ve ever had, but it was certainly in the top ten. So what does that mean? What can we learn?</p><p>First, the &#x201C;floor&#x201D; for great experiences will keep rising. If I picked my top 100 experiences waiting for food from the 80s until today, most of the best experiences would be in this decade, specifically the post-chatGPT era. I don&#x2019;t know that many would make the top 100 before the age of the smartphone. Maybe a few would sneak in for exceptional reasons, like spotting a celebrity in at the Cheesecake Factory in 1989 or something. But the average experience would skew heavily towards smartphones, google, and now chatGPT enabled moments.</p><p>Second, that doesn&#x2019;t mean we&#x2019;ve gotten less creative. It&#x2019;s because we&#x2019;ve gotten much, much, more creative. And yes, that&#x2019;s in huge part because of technological improvements. But so what? I don&#x2019;t think a DM is failing at being creative when they look something up in the D&amp;D Monster Manual, or double-check something in Google, or have an app to track magical effects during a scene. I think of that DM as well-prepared to bring their full creativity to bear on the game because they&#x2019;re offloading the fiddly bits to technology. Some of the best artists in the world have leaned into new technologies, and that&#x2019;s no small reason why they are considered great artists in hindsight. The act of creation requires a pioneering spirit.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>I would like to teach a class about this. Not about chatGPT per se, but more broadly about using lateral thinking and creativity-boosting techniques to create art. We&#x2019;ve been given the greatest tool in human history for dreaming up new concepts and ideas. Not boring ones that emerge from pressing a creativity button, but truly novel and human insights that you can only get from pairing an open-minded human to a huge breakthrough in technology.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>Postscript: when I finished this essay, I threw it into chatGPT to find grammatical issues. It found 1 typo, called out 1 error that&#x2019;s not an error, and had 3 suggestions I discarded. Imagine if I had accepted all 5 because I think AI is always right, or rejected all 5 because I think AI is always garbage. Both would be objectively worse than the way I used it. Those who master this blend, like grammar checkers or Google before it, will create more, with higher quality and confidence, than those who don&#x2019;t. It&#x2019;s already happening.</p>",2023-11-25 02:48:50,üí¨,8da0-5541

343,A new album from Blockhead,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/a-new-album-from-blockhead/,"<p>I like an artist named Blockhead, so I tried listening to his new album. It seemed good, but different. And then I noticed him making references to old samples from his previous albums, which seemed ballsy. Before 2023, I would have done a Metacritic search for the album, skimmed through reviews, and gathered information the best I could. This approach takes some time, especially if I get distracted, and can lead to biased results.</p><p>But it&#x2019;s 2023, so I asked chatGPT for reviews, especially from longtime fans like me. Then I went back to work and checked back on the result about 15 minutes later. It gave me everything I wanted to know. You might find it interesting too!</p><blockquote>Blockhead&apos;s album &quot;The Aux&quot; has garnered positive reviews from critics and presents a significant development in his production style. The album, marking his first rap album since collaborating with Aesop Rock in 2021, showcases his talent for bringing together artists from various eras and scenes, resulting in a dynamic and engaging listening experience. The diversity of guest artists and Blockhead&apos;s distinct production style create a unique blend of sounds that is both cohesive and varied&#x200B;&#x200B;.</blockquote><blockquote>Critics have noted that &quot;The Aux&quot; stands out as a significant work in Blockhead&apos;s discography, with one reviewer mentioning that it is their favorite solo album of his in recent memory, highlighting the tight performances of the guest emcees. The album scored an 8/10 in this review, indicating a high level of appreciation for its artistic qualities&#x200B;&#x200B;.</blockquote><blockquote>Blockhead himself has acknowledged that &quot;The Aux&quot; might present some &quot;speed bumps&quot; for longtime fans, particularly with the inclusion of tracks like RXK Nephew&apos;s &quot;Pink Lemonade,&quot; which diverges from his usual style. This deliberate choice reflects Blockhead&apos;s intent to challenge his audience and expose them to a wide range of hip-hop styles. His goal is to push boundaries and encourage open-mindedness among listeners, recognizing that every artist featured on the album brings their unique style, which might not align with traditional expectations of rap music&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;.</blockquote><blockquote>Overall, the reviews and reactions suggest that &quot;The Aux&quot; is a strong entry in Blockhead&apos;s discography, notable for its diverse range of guest artists and the producer&apos;s willingness to experiment and challenge both himself and his listeners.</blockquote>",2023-11-29 04:19:49,üí¨,1dce-f1bc
219,Genius,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/genius/,"<p>Oh how I hate the word genius.</p><p>We use it as a shorthand to mean &#x201C;super smart.&#x201D; But it lacks any objective definition. We can point to athletes and say &#x201C;she ran faster than anyone,&#x201D; or &#x201C;he jumped higher than anyone&#x201D; or &#x201C;that team scored more points than anyone.&#x201D; But when it comes to intelligence, we struggle to define it. You can be smart at one thing and dumb at many more things. Does that make you a genius?</p><p>Take Elon Musk. His efforts at Tesla and Space X make me think it&#x2019;s fair to call him &#x201C;smart&#x201D; or &#x201C;bright&#x201D; or &#x201C;intelligent&#x201D; or &#x201C;genius.&#x201D; Sure. Even if I wanted to argue that his genius is overrated, it&#x2019;s not like I can point to objective metrics to make my point. It just comes down to a subjective gut feeling, like calling someone &#x201C;hot&#x201D; or &#x201C;funny.&#x201D;</p><p><br>But there <em>are</em> objective metrics for product design, and he&#x2019;s one of the dumbest business leaders we&#x2019;ve ever witnessed, in the history of the world. Pull up chair. This is my specialty and I have receipts.</p><p>If a product has one million users before you take over, then two million users a year later, you can reasonably say you doubled the success of the product in the marketplace. And if you look at your peers and their growth is averaging 5% to your 100%, you can reasonably argue that you&#x2019;re a lot better. And if you wanted to throw the word &#x201C;genius&#x201D; around, sure, you could say you&#x2019;re a branding genius, or a marketing genius, or a product genius, or a business genius. Then people could look at the numbers and agree or disagree. But always through the lens of numbers and metrics.</p><p>So, using numbers are metrics, Elon Musk isn&#x2019;t just &#x201C;not a business genius,&#x201D; he&#x2019;s an abject failure. If you think that&#x2019;s just a squishy opinion, I&#x2019;ll direct you to the metrics. He bought a company for 44 billion that is now worth, by his own admission, less than half of that. His number of users is lower. His number of advertisers is lower. His income is lower. I don&#x2019;t know what his customer satisfaction numbers are, but Gallup is reporting that only 40% of Twitter users are sure they&#x2019;ll be using the service in a year. 35% are &#x201C;somewhat likely&#x201D; to use it, and 25% say not at all. (The number jumps to 35% when you ask women)</p><p>Elon Musk might be a science genius, and his marketing and branding eye seemed to have worked very well at Tesla. I&#x2019;m comfortable calling him a genius there, because I can point to the numbers that prove his savvy and acumen compared to his peers. But he&#x2019;s definitely not a social media, product design, or strategy genius. Nothing in his performance at Twitter could reasonably support that argument. Instead, Musk defenders are forced to explain why destroying a 44 billion dollar company can be called anything but a failure.</p><p>Imagine an experiment that could simulate how 100 random Americans handled being Twitter&#x2019;s CEO. I believe Musk would be outperformed by every single one. A large percentage of them would be terrified by the responsibility, so they probably wouldn&#x2019;t change much. They&#x2019;d probably lean heavily on their leadership team, and when faced with unified resistance to their ideas, they&#x2019;d probably back down from them. Another percentage would be more confident, but again, there would be a limit to how much they&#x2019;d attempt to change at once. No matter how much you hate Twitter, you probably wouldn&#x2019;t actively chase advertisers off the system, for example. But Musk did.</p><p>No one would be as bad at Musk. Blue collar workers, 16 year olds, old ladies who would rather be knitting and watching Matlock, consultants, other CEOs, no one could mess up as badly as he has done. And yet we call him a genius.</p><p>I&#x2019;m not saying he&#x2019;s stupid, necessarily. But I genuinely believe one hundred monkeys at typewriters would have done a better job running Twitter. So where does that leave us? Is he a genius at some things? Sure. But he&#x2019;s also the biggest loser in the history of CEOs. Both can be true at once, in the same person. But only one of those assertions is based on objective data. And that&#x2019;s the one that matters.</p>",2023-05-18 00:01:30,üí¨,97f6-cccc

344,Search engines are disappointing (examples 1 through 4),https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/search-engines-are-disappointing-examples-1-through-3/,"<p>I haven&#x2019;t liked search engines in a long time. Frankly, I&#x2019;ve been a little surprised by how much garbage people put up with when searching for information. It seems like we all decided that Google is the pinnacle of discovery, despite ample evidence of its shortcomings, because we have a failure of imagination.</p><p>I keep finding examples in head-to-head matchups where search engines completely fail me, but chatGPT doesn&#x2019;t. Here are some examples.</p><p><strong>Example 1: Is Hello, Tomorrow renewed for a second season?</strong></p><p>Search engines show links to ten different sites with headlines like &#x201C;Hello, Tomorrow rumours and updates.&#x201D;</p><p>chatGPT says &#x201C;As of now, Apple TV+ has not officially announced a renewal for a second season of &quot;Hello, Tomorrow!&quot;. However, there are various factors that suggest a potential renewal might be on the horizon. These include the unique and intriguing premise of the show, combining futuristic settings with sales themes, and the show&apos;s notable star, Billy Crudup, who has a strong relationship with Apple TV+ through his role in &quot;The Morning Show.&quot; Apple TV+ has a history of giving new shows more chances to succeed, which could bode well for &quot;Hello, Tomorrow!&quot; Ultimately, the decision to renew the series will depend on cumulative viewership and how much people watch over a relatively short period of time&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;.&#x201D;</p><p>Winner: chatGPT.</p><p><strong>Example 2: Was Winston Peters right about it taking 3 weeks instead of 40 days?</strong></p><p>Search engines don&#x2019;t answer the question, and instead serve up a bunch of general stories about Winston Peters. None of those stories give me my answer.</p><p>chatGPT said &#x201C;Winston Peters, the leader of New Zealand First, expressed confidence that a new government in New Zealand could be formed more quickly than what was being predicted by pundits and commentators. He critiqued the media for implying that the time taken for government formation in New Zealand was overly long. Peters emphasised that compared to countries like Germany, where forming a government could take up to five months, the process in New Zealand was relatively quick&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;.</p><p>Peters also highlighted a specific issue that contributed to the delay in government formation: the law change in 2020 that allowed people to enrol to vote on election day, a change that was supported by New Zealand First. This law extended the time required to confirm the final election results by an additional week, leading to a three-week delay between election night and the confirmation of the final results&#x200B;&#x200B;.</p><p>In contrast to Peters&apos; assertion that the government could be formed quickly, the actual process of forming the government in New Zealand in 2023 took 40 days of negotiations following the October 14 election. This duration was necessary for the conservative National Party leader Christopher Luxon to sign a coalition deal with two other parties, including New Zealand First&#x200B;&#x200B;.</p><p>Therefore, while Peters was optimistic and critical of the perceived slow pace of government formation as portrayed by the media, the actual duration of forming the government did indeed take approximately 40 days, contradicting his assertion that it could be done in a much shorter time frame.&#x201D;</p><p><strong>Example 3: How can I cook chicken breast to be juicy?</strong></p><p>Search engines give me a wall of recipes, YouTube videos, and &#x201C;people asked this question&#x201D; queries. Many of them are fine. Others are a pain to navigate because they&#x2019;re full of ads or extraneous information. But either way, search engines feel like asking a librarian a direct answer and have them point to 25 different books on a shelf. chatGPT gets right to the point and says this:</p><p>&#x201C;Cooking a juicy chicken breast involves a few key steps:</p><p><strong>Brining or Marinating:</strong> Soak the chicken in a brine (saltwater solution) or a marinade of your choice. This helps to retain moisture and add flavor.</p><p>Room Temperature: Bring the chicken to room temperature before cooking. This helps it cook more evenly.</p><p><strong>Cooking Method:</strong> Use methods like baking, grilling, or pan-searing. For pan-searing, cook the chicken over medium-high heat until golden brown on each side, then lower the heat to cook through.</p><p><strong>Don&apos;t Overcook:</strong> Use a meat thermometer to ensure the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165&#xB0;F (75&#xB0;C), but avoid overcooking as it can dry out the meat.</p><p><strong>Rest the Chicken:</strong> After cooking, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before cutting. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, keeping it moist.</p><p><strong>Proper Storage:</strong> If you&apos;re cooking chicken breast in advance, store it properly in the refrigerator to maintain its juiciness until serving.</p><p>Each of these steps helps to ensure that the chicken breast remains juicy and flavourful. Experiment with different seasonings and cooking methods to find your preferred taste and texture.&#x201D;</p><p><strong>Example 4: One day visiting Seattle, what should I do if handicapped</strong></p><p>Search engines do the same thing as before. Ten different articles where I can cross my fingers and hope for the best. Most people will read a few of these articles and cobble together a plan based on what multiple sources say.</p><p>chatGPT gives me an actual answer:</p><p>&#x201C;If you have one day to spend in Seattle and are looking for wheelchair-accessible activities, you have several excellent options. Here are some of the best attractions and activities you can enjoy:</p><p><strong>Sky View Observatory:</strong> Begin your day with breathtaking views of the city from the Sky View Observatory. It provides an excellent introduction to Seattle&apos;s beauty&#x200B;&#x200B;.</p><p><strong>Seattle Aquarium:</strong> Next, you can visit the Seattle Aquarium, where you can see a variety of marine life. The aquarium is accessible and offers a fascinating insight into aquatic animals and the surrounding waterways&#x200B;&#x200B;.</p><p><strong>Harbor Cruise with Argosy Cruises:</strong> Enjoy a scenic cruise with Argosy Cruises. Their Salish Explorer ship is wheelchair accessible, providing fantastic views of the Seattle skyline and a unique perspective of the city&#x200B;&#x200B;.</p><p><strong>The Seattle Great Wheel:</strong> Experience panoramic views of the city on The Seattle Great Wheel. Each pod is wheelchair accessible, providing a comfortable and scenic ride&#x200B;&#x200B;.</p><p><strong>Space Needle:</strong> No visit to Seattle is complete without a trip to the iconic Space Needle. It&apos;s accessible, with elevators to the observation deck, and offers stunning views of the city from various levels&#x200B;&#x200B;.</p><p><strong>Chihuly Garden and Glass:</strong> For art lovers, the Chihuly Garden and Glass museum showcases the spectacular glassworks of Dale Chihuly. The entire facility is wheelchair accessible, with all exhibits on one level&#x200B;&#x200B;.</p><p><strong>Museum of Pop Culture:</strong> Explore the Museum of Pop Culture, featuring exhibits on various aspects of pop culture. The museum is spacious and fully accessible, with elevators to different floors&#x200B;&#x200B;.</p><p><strong>Pacific Science Center:</strong> The Pacific Science Center is a family-friendly attraction with a wide range of exhibits, including an IMAX theater and a laser dome. The center is highly accessible, with facilities for people with disabilities&#x200B;&#x200B;.</p><p><strong>Olympic Sculpture Park:</strong> For a more relaxed experience, visit the Olympic Sculpture Park. It offers smooth paths throughout, large sculptures, and excellent waterfront views&#x200B;&#x200B;.</p><p><strong>Pike Place Market:</strong> A must-visit in Seattle, Pike Place Market is known for its vibrant atmosphere, with over 220 shops and restaurants. It&apos;s a great place to experience the local culture and buy souvenirs&#x200B;&#x200B;.</p><p><strong>Woodland Park Zoo:</strong> If you enjoy animal encounters, the Woodland Park Zoo is an excellent choice. The zoo features paved paths and is mostly flat, making it easy to navigate in a wheelchair&#x200B;&#x200B;.</p><p>Overall, Seattle offers a range of accessible activities and attractions, making it a great destination for visitors with mobility challenges. Remember that while the city is known for its hilly terrain, it offers excellent accessible public transportation options, including light rail, buses, and taxis with wheelchair ramps&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;.&#x201D;</p><hr><p>Sometimes, being shown a range of options is a good idea. If I asked for a good restaurant or book, I&#x2019;d expect more than a single answer. But imagine asking for a good restaurant or book and being given ten different websites, each with its own top recommendations. That&#x2019;s how we use search engines today.</p><p>The key is something in the middle: you want a range of options, but all in the form of an actual answer. For example, I just asked chatGPT for a good restaurant near me in Wellington and it gave me 12 great ideas. When I typed the same thing into Google, it offered three ideas (one of which won&#x2019;t be open for three days) and then punted to a bunch of sites like Yelp. It wasn&#x2019;t the worst answer, but it wasn&#x2019;t very good. In hindsight, we&#x2019;ll see how bad search engines really were in 2023. It&#x2019;ll just take a while to fully appreciate it.</p>",2023-11-25 19:59:26,üí¨,eed8-c0c1
383,The Apple Vision Pro as of February 15,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/the-apple-vision-pro-as-of-february-15/,"<p>Last year I predicted how the Apple Vision Pro might fare. Two weeks ago, as the product was launching, I compared my old predictions with my new ones. Now I&#x2019;d like to do some further modifications to see what I got wrong and provide some additional colour.</p><h3 id=""new-information-since-last-week"">New information since last week</h3><ul><li>Zuckerberg responded to AVP and compared it unfavourably to the Meta Quest 3</li><li>The big news story is how many people are returning their headsets</li><li>My mom said she doesn&#x2019;t understand the ads</li><li>The New York Times called the product lacking &#x201C;polish and purpose&#x201D;</li><li>And of course lots of people love their headsets and are excitedly talking about their experience online</li><li>The conventional wisdom is that for $500 you get better games and hand tracking, and a better overall product. Apple&#x2019;s $3500 AVP is slick, but not worth it.</li></ul><p>I don&#x2019;t completely disagree with any of these criticisms, but I would add some nuance to each of them. I&#x2019;ll get to that in a minute, but let me go compare my previous comments to how I feel now.</p><h3 id=""what-i-thought-then-vs-now"">What I thought then vs now</h3><p>The main thrust of my article two weeks ago was:</p><ul><li>It&#x2019;s too expensive</li><li>It&#x2019;s too heavy</li><li>The eyes look goofier than I expected</li><li>The future is perfect passthrough, this is now table stakes</li><li>The ambition was bigger than I expected</li><li>The interface was smoother than I expected</li><li>The long term success/failure won&#x2019;t be Beat Saber, it will be in how well they do the &#x201C;spatial computing&#x201D; concept &#x2014; macOS apps, specially designed AVP apps, etc.</li><li>Competition never understands that Apple&#x2019;s vertical integration is how they win, not one-off features</li></ul><p>And most of these things still reflect how I feel, with some minor tweaks:<br></p><ul><li>I didn&#x2019;t realise Meta Quest 3 could do Mac apps!</li><li>I didn&#x2019;t realise Meta Quest 3 passthrough was decent!</li></ul><p>And those two bulletpoints are enough to tank my entire premise. No, Meta doesn&#x2019;t have access to iPad or AVP apps. But yes, they do have access to Mac apps. And no, Meta doesn&#x2019;t have amazing eye tracking or as immersive of an experience as AVP &#x2026; but they&#x2019;re no slouches either. So where does that leave us?</p><h3 id=""zuck-has-some-good-points"">Zuck has some good points</h3><p>I thought Zuck&#x2019;s video was fair. His premise is the Meta Quest 3 is a better product, even if they were the same price. I think he makes a strong case for that &#x2014; it&#x2019;s lighter, has more native apps, games, and experiences, and has controllers for more precise tracking in space &#x2014; but this is where details matter. Is Quest 3 better for Beat Saber? Of course. Is Quest 3 better for people who want to select things with precision, using controllers? Also yes. But how many people want to gear up with controllers each time they use mixed reality? That&#x2019;s where things get a lot more unclear in my mind.</p><p>When the iPod first came out, it was criticised by Bluetooth fans for not having Bluetooth. When MacBook Air came out without a DVD drive, it was criticised for not having a DVD drive. iPads went through this when they shipped without a UNIX command line. But in all three cases, average users didn&#x2019;t miss the features nearly as much as the enthusiasts assumed they would. I&#x2019;ll go further: the products were <em>better</em> because they dropped the enthusiast&#x2019;s most loved features, which sounds counter-intuitive. It feels like saying &#x201C;You quench your thirst by not drinking water,&#x201D; but a better comparison is &#x201C;No matter how thirsty you are, don&#x2019;t drink salt water.&#x201D; Some features make the product worse. Handheld controllers for VR are salt water.</p><p>Or a stylus and keyboard on a phone.</p><p>You see where I&#x2019;m going with this.</p><h3 id=""the-details-and-execution-are-going-to-matter-a-ton"">The details and execution are going to matter a ton</h3><p>I&#x2019;ve always thought people are going to overlook how insurmountable Apple&#x2019;s tight hardware/software/cloud/credit card ecosystem is, and Zuck publicly (and I presume, privately) is falling right into the Ballmer trap. He spent 2 seconds in his video showing floating windows to say &#x201C;See, we can do productivity too.&#x201D; So he walks away from the comparison smiling, thinking &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve got all the same features, with more apps, at a lower price. Bring it on!&#x201D;</p><p>As a product designer and strategy guy, I see something different.</p><p>He thinks his controllers are a great idea, like Blackberry&#x2019;s keyboard or Palm&#x2019;s stylus. I think they&#x2019;re a horrible idea from old thinking, like Blackberry&#x2019;s keyboard or Palm&#x2019;s stylus. He thinks Meta has a competitive productivity situation, but that&#x2019;s a stretch. Here&#x2019;s what my research found:</p><p><strong>Apple Vision Pro&#x2019;s productivity experience</strong></p><ol><li>Flip open your laptop and your macOS screen immediately appears</li><li>You get access to any app on the Mac via this window</li><li>You also have apps specially made for AVP or iPad, and they work in their own windows. You can place as many as you want.</li></ol><p><strong>Meta Quest&#x2019;s productivity experience</strong></p><ol><li>Install 3rd party software to stream your Mac to your headset</li><li>Install the same software on your headset</li><li>From the OS&#x2019;s special toolbar, select &#x201C;Applications&#x201D; and launch the app</li><li>Now your Mac window is floating in front of you. (You get 3 windows, total)</li></ol><p>On Quest, the resolution is worse, which matters a lot for reading things on screen. The hand gestures you use are much more complicated. The latency is worse. I believe you can only show three windows, but I could be wrong. Simple things like a Mail client aren&#x2019;t available (according to the YouTube research I did) so you&#x2019;re stuck doing everything from a web browser. I presume there&#x2019;s nothing preventing Google from making a Gmail client for Quest 3, but there are a lot of great software products, not just email, in the App Store that will never port over to an entirely new system. That&#x2019;s not a small hurdle. I&#x2019;d argue it&#x2019;s a big enough gap that it&#x2019;ll be unsurmountable, as it always is against Apple.</p><h3 id=""operating-systems-and-apps-matter-a-lot-a-lot"">Operating systems and apps matter a lot a lot</h3><p>Apple Vision Pro has done everything it can to make the operating system metaphorically transparent. It&#x2019;s trivial for your favourite iPad app to be brought over to AVP with full fidelity. The only time you&#x2019;ll directly experience an administrative OS task is when launching the app from the Home Screen, or resizing windows to your liking. macOS support is similar. You flip open your laptop and the screen is floating there in space. That&#x2019;s about as &#x201C;two boxes, one arrow&#x201D; as a UX flow can possibly be, and as a designer that&#x2019;s an A+.</p><p>Meta Quest has a tougher kill to climb. They need you to install, learn, and use a completely new OS, with its own store and interface conventions. It can&#x2019;t augment your existing software library, so it needs you to start from scratch. If you love using OmniFocus (a todo list app) on your Mac, you go to the Oculus store and search for &#x201C;<a href=""https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/search/?q=todo+list&amp;ref=a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io"">todo list</a>&#x201D; there&#x2019;s a single result for a product called SWORDS OF GARGANTUA, which costs $24.99 and I&#x2019;m guessing it won&#x2019;t sync with Taskpaper. I could go into all the reasons this is a problem, but I think you get it. Lack of apps, people have software they love and expect to keep using, syncing across platforms via the cloud, a max of three windows, etc etc. D-.</p><p>And that&#x2019;s before you get into the complex hand gestures and controllers required to pilot this OS. I get it, controllers are great for games. But they&#x2019;re awful for the actual productivity tasks an office worker will have to perform every day. If I need to set down physical controllers to switch between tasks, you&#x2019;ve lost me. (&#x201C;If you see a stylus, they blew it.&#x201D;) And even the hand tracking requires an arcane set of commands to do basic things. It&#x2019;s too much for most people, and always will be.</p><h3 id=""credit-where-credit-is-due"">Credit where credit is due</h3><p>The Meta Quest 3 is indeed better at passthrough and Mac mirroring than I thought. That definitely removes a lot of my enthusiasm for just how far ahead AVP is in version one. I thought I was comparing a 2007 iPhone to a 2007 Blackberry, when in reality the comparison is closer to Android.</p><p>This is where Zuckerberg and I agree, but I think he&#x2019;d find the comparison exciting and I think it&#x2019;s damning. If you think Apple succeeded with iPhone <em>despite</em> being a &#x201C;closed walled garden,&#x201D; I think you&#x2019;re missing the plot. You might genuinely believe that people want to go back to the Windows era, where choice, flexibility, and power won out over simplicity and ease-of-use. You might even squint and believe your product is has a &#x201C;good enough&#x201D; UX and that the real differentiators in the market will be games and price.</p><p>But let&#x2019;s not be revisionist here. I worked in tech support for many years, and can confidently report than non-nerds have always hated their Windows computers for being too difficult to use. In hindsight, non-nerds loved the Blackberry product for always-on internet access, but hated the actual interface/experience, compared to simpler products that came later. (They&#x2019;re no longer in business, which is worth noting) Linux on Desktop has gotten better and better, but never reached the quality bar needed to be a viable system for non-nerds, because Mac and even Windows were just easier to use.</p><p><br>The fight for the headset space won&#x2019;t be between &#x201C;closed&#x201D; and &#x201C;open&#x201D; for two reasons. First, Quest is very much a closed systems, despite Meta&#x2019;s claims to the contrary. But even if they were truly open source, the fight for the future is the same as we&#x2019;ve seen in the past. The better product will win. I think Zuckerberg would agree with that statement, and is pretty confident that he does indeed have the better overall product. (&#x201C;Same features, plus we do more, plus we&#x2019;re cheaper.&#x201D;) But what I see is Desktop Linux, on my face, requiring controllers and odd hand gestures, and none of the apps I&#x2019;m used to. Who understands the mainstream market more, me or Zuckerberg? Apple or Meta? We&#x2019;ll see!</p>",2024-02-15 20:15:58,üí¨,b870-6f73
350,"A simple app, as distraction",https://jbell.weblog.lol/2023/12/a-simple-app-as-distraction,"
<p>I have a lot of things I need to be working on, so that makes it more appealing to work on things I don't need to be working on. I just started at my screen and decided ""Right. Ok. I'm going to do an iPhone app."" This sounds more impressive than it is. Let me explain why.</p>
<p>A few months ago, I figured out how to get a simple iOS app to talk to data on the internet. So I know how to do that now. And I know a lot about putting that data on the internet, so that's not a big deal. Finally, I have chatGPT to help me with tricky bits, which is how I learned how to make a simple iOS app in the first place. So I've got this, from a technical standpoint.</p>
<p>Scope is another important detail. Obviously I can't sit down and make something highly polished and professional. But I can do a one-page app. One where you launch the app, it pulls down data and shows it, with no other bells and whistles. So I'll be fine, as long as I scope it correctly.</p>
<p>What is the app? I'll just say it's something I've worked on for years, and this is just one more step in the evolution of an idea I spend a lot of time on already. So it helps that I'm not chasing a left field idea that just occurred to me. There's no need to define it much more than that for now. Wish me luck!</p>",2023-12-09 00:14:00,üìá,469a-3521
349,The follow-up to the thing I just said,https://jbell.weblog.lol/2023/12/the-follow-up-to-the-thing-i-just-said,"
<p>In my previous post, I went out of my way to dream up a plan for tackling a new iOS app. I explained all the ways I'd do it, and why it would be a good use of time, and how I could scope it well. By the end of the article, I was getting a tingly feeling that I did my best to ignore. It was telling me that I didn't want to do the iOS app anymore. I ignored it and hit publish.</p>
<p>I spent about 30 minutes working on the iOS app, but the tingle turned into a roar. It wasn't that I felt guilty about procrastinating or anything high-minded like that. I just wasn't as interested in it anymore. Writing it down broke the fever and took the thrill out of it. Those first 30 minutes found me battling with some basic compile errors, ones I knew how to address. But I had lost interest. My mind had turned elsewhere ‚Äì to the work I should have been doing in the first place.</p>
<p>It doesn't always work like this, but it often does. Creative work often requires aiming in a counter-intuitive way to get the results you want. Like how looking at a faint star can feel more clear looking away from it, sometimes the way I break through writer's block is by doing anything else. I feinted towards iOS, tricked my writer's block in that direction, then cut back towards my thesis. Checkmate.</p>
<p>Maybe I should start playing chess again?</p>
<p>Damn it.</p>",2023-12-09 20:38:00,üìá,54fe-ec2c

At the end of the essay, I shared these images of how the product looked as of then, November¬†2021:</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*G17yfo5CcCDct40uGN6p6Q.png"" /><figcaption>Viewer mode¬†(2021)</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*hDs4qMoo08fO36B_Yg6Isg.png"" /><figcaption>DevTools mode¬†(2021)</figcaption></figure><p>Pretty straight-forward, yes? In Viewer mode, we show a big video with some comments on the side. In DevTools mode, we show developers things they‚Äôre used to seeing, like a console, source viewer, element panel, a call stack, breakpoints, and so forth. If you‚Äôre not a developer, worry not! This is a design lesson about the details that emerge when your product gets more mature. If you like to learn about design, product strategy, and herding cats at a small company, you‚Äôre the target audience for this article. For more technical stuff, <a href=""https://blog.replay.io"">check out our¬†blog</a>.</p><p>Ok! It‚Äôs design tour¬†time!</p><h4>How things look as we kick off¬†2024</h4><p>These images look pretty similar to 2021. The comments on the left have thumbnails, the icons are a little different, and there are some small differences. Those small differences are where all the good stuff¬†is!</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*XZCPhoFqWwTrPXfCJml4uw.png"" /><figcaption>Viewer mode¬†(2024)</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2Ngbkn9Oyf_-KWYbYfFROw.png"" /><figcaption>DevTools mode¬†(2024)</figcaption></figure><h4>Jump to¬†code</h4><p>See this blue button in the image below? It‚Äôs absolutely amazing.</p><p>Clicking it takes you to the exact line of code that ran when an event happened, which lets you dive right in and figure out what‚Äôs what. We‚Äôve even joked about making into a t-shirt because it‚Äôs such a great example of what Replay can do, and it saves people tons of¬†time.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SHekWk8Y6XVxvOTWzZtBlA.png"" /></figure><p>I love this feature and use it constantly, usually right when I start investigating something. It‚Äôs hard to imagine there was ever a time where we didn‚Äôt have this¬†feature!</p><h4>Hit counts</h4><p>Two years ago, we distinguished between lines of code that were run or not in a binary way. It was either on or off, dark gray or light gray. Today, we show the number of times a line was called, and we use a heat map-style darkening to call out lines that are called more often, as shown above in those different shades of¬†blue.</p><p>At first, this idea was internally controversial because we never want to clutter the UI unnecessarily. But seeing it in action made it clear that it had earned its place in the¬†UI.</p><h4>Version 843 of our print statement panel</h4><p>Ok, 843 is a slight exaggeration. But even if we had, it‚Äôd be worth it. This feature is one of the most important things in our entire product, so it needs to work really well. Here‚Äôs how it looked in November 2021, cue the sad¬†trumpet:</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZTwpqgIQ8o2HWScM3VNwaQ.png"" /><figcaption>Print statement panel, November¬†2021</figcaption></figure><p>And here‚Äôs how it looks today, cue the Chariots of Fire soundtrack:</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*du7gmVYPqcGoNFSKAQWxxw.png"" /><figcaption>Print statement panel, January¬†2024</figcaption></figure><p>Obviously the visual treatment is better. But without getting into the weeds about bunch of technical/research details, let‚Äôs just talk about pure UX for a moment. First things first: it‚Äôs really important that people understand the top region is editable, so obviously the previous design was doing a bad job at that and it was addressed in the new design. Easy and obvious¬†win.</p><p>Next, <a href=""https://lawsofux.com/law-of-proximity/"">related things should be near each other</a>, which is why we moved the little 2/3 indicator to be beside the forward and backward buttons. Again, it seems simple in hindsight, but it took some exploration to get there. Another very helpful step was adding a context menu, but of course you can‚Äôt just tuck everything away and call it a day. A lot of code, research, and design effort went into making this seemingly straight-forward menu.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jCTTaTOfX7eXgeLPQe1eLw.png"" /></figure><h4>Labels (and unicorns!)</h4><p>Sometimes it can help to figure out what line of code is being called out in your console. A classic ‚Äúneedle in the haystack situation,‚Äù which we handled by adding a cute little label selector. I had a lot of fun drawing that pixelated unicorn.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SbgWClCOi43QL1KDAUo1Rw.png"" /></figure><p>In practice, it works like this. It allows you to set a label at the line of code (left side of this image) and see the results in the console (right¬†side).</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Oe_GIegJZaJiC1aFWhW00A.png"" /></figure><h4>Focus Mode</h4><p>Our app is very timeline-oriented, but you usually don‚Äôt watch a video from start to finish the way you might while binge-watching One Piece on Netflix. Often you want to focus on one part of a video while debugging, so we made something called Focus Mode. Rather than repeat myself here, I can just link to the articles we wrote about the feature last year, one when the feature was new and one we wrote when we improved it significantly:</p><ul><li><a href=""https://medium.com/replay-io/how-we-designed-our-focus-mode-595711802998"">How We Designed Our Focus Mode</a></li><li><a href=""https://medium.com/replay-io/how-we-improved-our-focus-mode-db5888f77b1a"">How We Improved Our Focus Mode</a></li></ul><h4>Our confusing layout¬†button</h4><p>We informally refer to this set of tabs as our ‚Äútoolbox.‚Äù On top is how things looked two years ago, on bottom is how it looks today. Let‚Äôs start by talking about that strange icon on the top right. What the heck is that? A feature that wins the award for ‚Äúmost useful feature zero people discovered on their own.‚Äù¬†Yikes.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YoJTBR6Np18HwItWW_dHYA.png"" /><figcaption>Old on top, new on bottom. More powerful but¬†simpler!</figcaption></figure><p>Clicking that icon adjusts the layout of the page. If you‚Äôre familiar with Chrome DevTools, you may have used a similar feature in this¬†menu:</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PNQeE9XAalLjUt2q6TCmJA.png"" /></figure><p>People have a reason to click a kabob (three vertical dots) or a hamburger (three horizontal lines) because they know it means ‚Äúthis is a menu! Good stuff will be tucked away here!‚Äù But our icon just looked confusing. It looked like a status indicator rather than an actual thing you can click, so no one did. We put it into the top menu, so now it works like¬†this:</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/1*cJS9G0lltdKiLPOHNWr6oQ.gif"" /></figure><h4>More powerful + more approachable</h4><p>Let‚Äôs bring up this comparison image again. There‚Äôs a lot going on here. The product got much more capable thanks to Network and React panels and rewrites of our Console and Elements panels. But this UI also got a lot simpler. We removed the trash can and tucked our menu items into our new hamburger menu. The end result is a product that‚Äôs much more powerful yet feels a lot more approachable. Livin‚Äô the¬†dream!</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8FsXGIDWykf-cj4eUCxX2Q.png"" /></figure><h4>Our new filter¬†menu</h4><p>Without going into lots of detail, let‚Äôs just say this menu on the side is doing a lot of great stuff that didn‚Äôt exist in¬†2021.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1R5urM-NDd9RwNCyjDkrnw.png"" /></figure><h4>Source maps</h4><p>Great UX doesn‚Äôt call attention to itself unnecessarily, which is why I love the simplicity of this feature. It‚Äôs so straight-forward that there feels like no other way to handle it. I won‚Äôt bore you with the details, but there were a lot of ways to get this wrong, and we iterated past them and got to this seemingly simple bit of UI. I love¬†it.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*x4Z9Q6iWcESxzzmHfRWKWA.png"" /></figure><h4>Dark theme, obviously</h4><p>Of course we lovingly spent time making sure our dark theme looks and feels great too. The majority of our users use the product in this mode, including (nearly) everyone on our team, so we wanted to make sure it get it feeling just¬†right.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GauQVWK7ZCRDTWWUvLdUZA.png"" /></figure><h4>Odds and ends for another¬†article</h4><p>Oh gosh, there are so many other things I wanted to get to, but they‚Äôll be best put into another article. So let‚Äôs switch gears and talk about airplane cockpits for a¬†moment.</p><h4>A story about airplane¬†cockpits</h4><p>Sometimes designers use the term ‚Äúairplane cockpit‚Äù to explain an overly complex interface. Do people really want hundreds of different buttons and indicators? It seems so complicated and confusing! Most designers have an instinct to reduce the number of buttons, simplify the overall appearance, and make something more streamlined.</p><p>It turns out they tried this once. The polished, simplified, streamlined, ‚Äúdesign-led‚Äù cockpit redesign failed in practice. Why? Because ‚Äúsimple‚Äù and ‚Äúeasy‚Äù are two different concepts but it‚Äôs easy to confuse them. Powerful and complex things often require complex and powerful UI, but that doesn‚Äôt automatically mean they‚Äôre poorly designed. Super-simple interfaces look slick in a portfolio, but that doesn‚Äôt automatically mean they succeed with real users trying to get real work¬†done.</p><p>Which brings us to Replay, a time travelling debugger. Getting our v1 out the door, as difficult as it was, was the easy part. We‚Äôre in the thick of the hardest design work now, which is taking a solid UX foundation and adding a bunch of powerful features that developers expect when debugging‚Ä¶ while keeping the product easy to understand, fast, and a joy to¬†use.</p><p>Our work is never done, but we‚Äôve done a great job with this balance so far, and we‚Äôre looking forward to pushing further this year.¬†Onward!</p><img src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=6b67527f8c2f"" width=""1"" height=""1"" alt="""">",2024-01-02 20:08:51,üìù,0a91-1341

370,Where Everybody Knows Your Name,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/where-everybody-knows-your-name/,"<p>I&#x2019;ve been part of a small online community for 20 years or more. It&#x2019;s invite only, it predates things like Twitter and Facebook, and these are people who have communicated every day or nearly every day in a group chat since the George W Bush administration. So as you can imagine, the vibes are good at the group is very tight-knit. Inside jokes, in-person meetups, you get the idea.</p><p>I haven&#x2019;t been involved with the group for about a year. Before that, I hadn&#x2019;t been involved for much longer, maybe about 7 years. I&#x2019;ve met up with many of these people in real life, so even when I was on hiatus I was talking to some of them in person and online, just not as part of the broader group. And I never left for any huge reason. There was no big blow up. So I recently dropped back into the chat and after two weeks realised why I had left in the first place.</p><p>Everyone is lovely! When I returned, people welcomed me warmly. The conversations were still very active, many posts a day across many categories. There were interesting links and engaging banter, and it was all helped along by a culture that can only exist when a bunch of very close people talk every day. So it was great. It was fine. But I seem to be having an allergic reaction to it, besides. There&#x2019;s a great song about it that sums things up, I think:</p><blockquote>You are a China shop and I am a bull<br>You are really good food and I am full<br>I guess everything is timing, I guess everything&apos;s been said<br>So I am coming home with an empty head</blockquote><p>There&#x2019;s a certain vibe, and a certain alignment, that I don&#x2019;t really share anymore. If I ever did. One topic came up, I was the only one representing my point of view. It&#x2019;s not like people attacked or harassed me, and it wasn&#x2019;t uncomfortable or awkward. Then it happened again, and again. And it felt like I could speak the language, but I wasn&#x2019;t fluent in it. It felt like if I had been around for the last 7 years, I&#x2019;d probably agree with everything everyone was saying. It was like I had let my membership lapse and my card didn&#x2019;t work anymore. I don&#x2019;t think I need to return my card or say goodbye. I don&#x2019;t need it to be a gesture, and I don&#x2019;t need to leave forever. But like an allergic reaction, my body is clearly telling me something. They&#x2019;re really good food, but it doesn&#x2019;t agree with me anymore.</p><p>As you get older, it can be harder to backfill friends you&#x2019;ve drifted away from. New friends don&#x2019;t have that same foundational root structure that keeps long term conversations going.

Hm, decidedly mixed reviews indeed.<br /><br />So I made it a second time this week, and did much better! It‚Äôs less sweet, less gag-worthy, and overall it worked really well.

386,"Ok, Breathe. It's February 24th.",https://academia.lot23.com/post/44,"As is the tradition for blogs that start with lots of lofty dreams, posting has slowed to a crawl. I think this is the part in the journey where I say ""sorry for not posting in a while,"" followed by a promise to post more, but then never post again. With a post date of seven years ago.<br /><br />But not me! I'm going to break the pattern, for several good reasons. First, this blog is written sequentially, so if this is the last post I ever write, it won't feel quite as sad. It'll just be the end of the story! But second, and much more importantly, I have a lot of stuff still going on. I'm landing the plane! It feels like my engines are on fire and I'm coming in at too-steep an angle, but one way or the other I am going to get this bird back on the ground. In today's essay I am going to explain the status of a bunch of things and come up with a plan for what is coming next.<br /><br />**Due in March (June)**<br />I have a personal goal to have things wrapped up by the Ides of March, which is about two and a half weeks away. And that's still possible, probably. But it will be a stretch. But the more important thing to remember is that I actually have until June. Personal, unrealistic goal: March. Actual deadline: 3 months later. So the stress that I'm feeling is natural and good, but also a complete construct.<br /><br />In a perfect world, I'll be able to ""soft launch"" in March, to use a software term, and then switch into a different gear for getting things out the door in June.<br /><br />**""A letter to my advisor"" nailed it**<br />It's funny how accurate my post from December ended up being. Proust and the Squid, Madame Bovary, making things more readable and accessible for everyone, etc. That was the moment I was able to see through the clouds and see out ahead of me. To recap, here's the story I'll be telling:<br /><br />1. Reading isn't natural, and comprehension is hard<br />2. There are ways to improve comprehension<br />3. But a lot of methods are unwieldy, like having to watch a YouTube video or read a whole other book.<br />4. There are ways to sprinkle help through texts<br />5. Here are a bunch of comparisons showing ways this could work<br /><br />**I'm excited by my methodology**<br />The biggest, gnarliest, scariest part of this paper was figuring out how I was going to quantify things. If I assert that feature X is better than feature Y, how can I prove that? The mind -- or at least my mind -- first goes to the standard ""get a bunch of people to perform tasks, then record how long it takes them to complete them"" quantitative approach. But I didn't want to do that. First, it's a pain. Second, I don't know that comparing 4 seconds to 11 seconds is a meaningful enough comparison.<br /><br />So I ended up with a whole slate of things to measure, mixing qualitative with quantitative, and all put into a single unified spreadsheet. It feels great, and I'm pretty excited about it.<br /><br />**Next I want to group things by comparisons**<br />Today it dawned on me that I need to compare things to other things. For example, I can say that finding the last page I've read in a book takes x seconds, and a digital version of the same takes y seconds. And then I can record the same data for a few dozen things. And then you're left with a list, but not enough context. Better would be to say ""here's one way to do a thing, and here's a second way to do that thing, and here's how they differ."" So I'll be working on that next. Well, almost next.<br /><br />**First I need to flesh out more of the sections I haven't written yet**<br />I have some sections at the end of my paper that say TBD. But I'd like to flesh them out with something so I can at least squint and get a sense of how things are coming together. So I'll do that, then I'll do the comparison grouping work. Then it'll be in a pretty good place.<br /><br />**Next week**<br />I'll be meeting with my advisor Walter next week, on Monday. By then, two things will have happened. First, my paper will be better. Second, Walter will come with a bunch of feedback for me. This means I can be in a good place to hear his feedback and make the final changes I'll need to. Hopefully that sends me on my final route to completion.<br /><br />**Oh yeah**<br />I almost forgot. I also need to put all my citations back in! This isn't a small task, but at least I'm not starting from scratch. I'd love to put it at the end, but I know I should do it earlier.<br /><br />So that's my status! Now I need to dive in.<br />",2024-02-24 01:41:24,üéì,d333-19ea

The M stood for MySQL, a database. I got pretty good at LAMP, and I could figure out the M well enough. But that was a long time ago.</p><p>Now I&#x2019;m learning about how people do databases in this decade, and there&#x2019;s a lot of fun stuff to take in. I think I&#x2019;m pretty close to being able to make real applications &#x2013; ones that use databases! &#x2013; again. I&#x2019;m pretty excited.

A few days ago I finally posted a cutesy loading animation. I&#x2019;m thrilled with it, and I can see some additional things to add to it.</p><p>I feel the same way about the Firehose animation on this site. It adds a little bit of joy that can go a long way.</p><p><strong>Firehose continues to be flippin&#x2019; amazing</strong><br>Once Firehose can tuck everything into a database, it opens up all sorts of new opportunities. I&#x2019;m reeling thinking about the thing I&#x2019;m building because I think can be truly great. Something someone would even pay money for. Imagine!<br></p><p><strong>It&#x2019;s hot </strong><br>I live in the Southern Hemisphere and good gravy it&#x2019;s been hot lately. The end of summer is coming, and you know what that means. It means the Northern Hemisphere is about to experience spring!<br></p><p><strong>Prince Harry&#x2019;s book</strong><br>I am enjoying it a lot.</p><p><strong>NANA and AKIRA</strong><br>For very different reasons, and to scratch very different itches, I am reading both NANA and AKIRA. I&#x2019;m clicking with them more than I am used to clicking with Manga, so we&#x2019;ll see how that pans out.</p><p><strong>Our Mathematical Universe</strong><br>I&#x2019;m reading this for the second time. I bought it for my son. I told my friends and mom about it. I am trying to process the theory and I keep getting stuck. I&#x2019;ll talk to GPT about it to explain where I&#x2019;m getting stuck, and where I hope to eventually get un-stuck.</p><p><strong>Me: </strong>Hi, I&apos;m reading Our Mathematical Universe. Do you know it?</p><p><strong>Bot:</strong> Yes, I am aware of the book &quot;Our Mathematical Universe&quot; by Max Tegmark. It is a popular science book that explores the concept that the physical universe is a mathematical structure and that everything in the universe, including matter and consciousness, can be explained by mathematics. The book provides an overview of the theories and ideas in physics, cosmology, and computer science that support this idea.</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> Right. So I am having trouble comprehending the book. Everything makes sense until he talks about the concept of inflation. Then suddenly he says all these crazy things like they&apos;ve been proven and I just can&apos;t follow it.</p><p>So can you explain what inflation is at a level a ten-year-old can understand? Can then can you explain why the existence of inflation means that there are a truly infinite number of universes that contain every version of me that could possibly exist? How can this be proven?</p><p><strong>Bot:</strong> Sure! I&apos;ll do my best to explain the concept of inflation in a simple way.</p><p>Imagine you blow up a balloon. At first, the balloon is small, but as you blow air into it, it starts to get bigger and bigger. This is kind of like what happens during inflation in the universe. Inflation is a theory that says, in the very beginning of the universe, everything was very small and close together. But then, suddenly, the universe started to get bigger and bigger very quickly, like blowing up a balloon.</p><p>As for why the existence of inflation means there are a truly infinite number of universes, it&apos;s because inflation suggests that our universe may have started as a tiny patch of space that grew and expanded very quickly. This expansion could have created other patches of space that became separate universes. So, in theory, there could be an infinite number of universes out there, each with their own version of you.</p><p>The existence of inflation cannot be proven with 100% certainty, as it is still a theory. However, there is some evidence that supports the theory, such as patterns in the cosmic microwave background radiation (the afterglow of the Big Bang), that are consistent with the predictions of inflation. But more research and data is needed to confirm this theory.</p><p><strong>Me: </strong> Thank you for that, that makes sense mostly.</p><p>But I still don&apos;t understand the infinity part. The author says that because of inflation, there is a version of me with three eyeballs. There is a version of me that is president of the United States. There&apos;s a version of me that has landed on Mars. Literally everything exists, with no limitations, because everything branches off at every moment.</p><p>How in the world does inflation imply that somewhere in the multiverse I am married to Barack Obama? Or somewhere in the multiverse I am an ant? I just don&apos;t see that connection.</p><p><strong>Bot:</strong> The idea that inflation implies that every possible version of reality exists in some universe is based on the concept of the &quot;many-worlds interpretation&quot; of quantum mechanics. This interpretation states that every time there is a quantum event (such as an electron jumping from one energy level to another), the universe splits into multiple universes, each containing a different outcome.</p><p>So, in this interpretation, every time there is a decision point or a chance event in your life, the universe splits into multiple universes, each containing a different outcome of that event. This means that, in some universes, you may have made a different choice or ended up in a different situation, leading to a different version of you.</p><p>This idea is combined with the concept of inflation to suggest that these many different universes created by the splitting of reality in quantum events could have been created during the rapid expansion of the universe during inflation.</p><p>So, the idea is that, due to inflation and the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, every possible version of reality, no matter how unlikely or fantastical, exists in some universe in the multiverse. That includes a version of you who is married to Barack Obama, a version of you who is an ant, and a version of you with three eyeballs.</p><p>It&apos;s important to note, however, that this idea is purely speculative and has not been proven. The multiverse and the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics are still the subject of ongoing research and debate in the scientific community.</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> Fair enough. So every time there is a quantum event, the universe splits. That&apos;s the theory.</p><p>And where&apos;s the evidence for this theory? That sounds INSANE.</p><p><strong>Bot:</strong> The many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is a theory that has been proposed to explain some of the strange and seemingly random behavior of subatomic particles in the quantum world. It is one of several interpretations of quantum mechanics and is not universally accepted by the scientific community.</p><p>As for evidence, there is currently no experimental evidence that directly supports the many-worlds interpretation. This is because the many-worlds interpretation is a purely theoretical construct and cannot be directly observed or tested.</p><p>However, proponents of the many-worlds interpretation argue that it provides a consistent and coherent explanation for the strange behavior of subatomic particles and resolves some of the paradoxes of quantum mechanics. They also argue that the theory is compatible with current experimental results and is not in conflict with any established scientific laws.</p><p>It&apos;s important to note that the many-worlds interpretation is still a subject of debate and discussion in the scientific community, and there are many other interpretations of quantum mechanics that have been proposed. While some physicists and philosophers find the many-worlds interpretation compelling, others view it as an untestable and untenable theory.</p><p><strong>Me: </strong> Thanks, bro. I think I understand more now.</p><p><strong>Bot: </strong> You&apos;re welcome! I&apos;m glad I could help clarify things for you. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.</p>",2023-02-05 09:04:34,üí¨,5588-eba1
315,We‚Äôre Leaving Stackworld,https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/were-leaving-stackworld/,"<p>Buckle up, I can already tell I am going to be referring back to this article for years. I have some big words, and a glimpse into what I see coming in the future, and I know some of it seems over-hyped. I know some of it seems unlikely. I&#x2019;m standing on a limb saying some of these things, yet I am convinced I&#x2019;ll be proven right, in broad brushstrokes. The future seems pretty clear.</p><p>Vision Pro is going to change everything.</p><p>You&#x2019;re welcome to roll your eyes, chalk that up as an over-hyped Apple fanatic feeling impatient about the coming release, and moving on. But I&#x2019;ve got some data to back this up. I have some insights to share. This is a bigger deal than people realise, partially because the price tag is so insane and partially because strapping a computer to your face can&#x2019;t possibly have a future. Right? We&#x2019;ll see, but first let me share a UX metaphor with you.</p><p>What if I handed you a stack of cards and asked you to find the ace of hearts. You&#x2019;d flip, flip, flip them one by one until you found it. But what if those 52 cards were arrayed in a grid? You&#x2019;d find the ace of spades much faster because your eye wouldn&#x2019;t have to navigate a stack, flip, flip, flip, you could just find the thing you want. Right now your phone and laptop are stack world. And it sucks.</p><p>You&#x2019;re reading this in one tab, but if you want you can open another tab. Unfortunately many of us have a lot of tabs. Maybe even lots of tabs across lots of browser windows. Flip, flip, flip. And below that, you have probably 12 layers of other apps., flip, flip, flip. But that takes too long, so you command-tab your way through apps, but one at a time of course, flip, flip, flip. It&#x2019;s quite slow. We&#x2019;re stuck in stackworld but we don&#x2019;t even notice because it&#x2019;s the best system we&#x2019;ve come up with.</p><p>Now, let me be clear. I&#x2019;m not claiming strapping a heavy chunk of metal and glass to your face is the answer for everything, or even most things. I&#x2019;m not claiming there&#x2019;s going to be some kind of revolution in 2024 where suddenly a spatial computing ecosystem puts our traditional computing ecosystem to shame. I&#x2019;m simply pointing out that <em>some</em> experiences are unequivocally better experienced spatially rather than as stacks. And that <em>some</em> developers will make some extraordinary experiences, and <em>some</em> consumers will try them and like them. This will be a slow burn, but once you try it, Stack World will feel like using an old Nokia flip phone after getting used to an iPhone.</p><p>Sounds like big words, right? They are, but they&#x2019;re backed up by the early hands-on reviews. For example, here&#x2019;s <a href=""https://youtu.be/OFvXuyITwBI?si=kn-eT90RVynIHRkX&amp;ref=a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io"">Marques Brownlee</a> saying it was the closest thing to magic he&#x2019;s experienced. Or <a href=""https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2023/08/31/ep-384?ref=a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io"">try listening to Michael Simmons</a>, designer of Fantastical, freak out about how the product is a sure-fire hit that will change software design forever. Yes, it&#x2019;s a big dumb face computer. But it&#x2019;s an absolutely game-changing big dumb face computer. It might take 5-10 years until it&#x2019;s truly mainstream, but it will go mainstream. And as it does, we&#x2019;ll second-guess the assumption that all software works best as a single card of information meant to exist in a hard-to-navigate stack.</p><p>Designers like me who have spent a lifetime figuring out the best practices for Stackworld are going to have to switch gears. We&#x2019;re going to have to figure out 3d scenes, choreography, directing attention the way cinema does, and a bunch of other skills that seem esoteric to us today. But it&#x2019;s coming. Stackworld will always be with us in some way, but its limitations will become clearer in the next few years. I can&#x2019;t wait.</p>",2023-09-10 05:14:09,üí¨,9205-e257

378,"The Apple Vision Pro as of February 1st, 2024",https://a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io/the-apple-vision-pro-as-of-february-1st-2024/,"<p>I love predictions. Show me someone saying there was no way Trump would win in 2016, or someone who said Apple Watch would be a flop in 2014. Show me someone who predicted Biden winning Super Tuesday or that Roe would be struck down by the Supreme Court. And most importantly, show me the receipts! I want to understand how they got there.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve spent many months talking and writing about Apple Vision Pro, and it&#x2019;s clear that I represent the far end of the spectrum when it comes to how impressed I am by it. The criticisms are easy to level, and I don&#x2019;t disagree with any of them. It&#x2019;s way too expensive, it&#x2019;s way too heavy, we haven&#x2019;t decided that people actually need or want something like this in our lives, the battery is weak, the battery pack is awkward, and have I mentioned it&#x2019;s $3500USD? But as valid as all of those criticisms are, I&#x2019;ve been surprised by how little people are talking about the flip side, the things that are actually cool or interesting.</p><p>But before we get to all that, let me dust off some old things I&#x2019;ve written about the product, to keep myself honest about the things I got right and wrong. On June 7th, I wrote a post that says I was wrong about Apple Vision Pro. I called out these items:<br></p><ul><li>I thought people would hate it more</li><li>I was sure there wouldn&#x2019;t be eyeballs on the front</li><li>I thought it would be VR, not AR</li><li>I didn&#x2019;t realise they&#x2019;d go so big on apps/macOS</li><li>I didn&#x2019;t think the interface would be this good</li><li>Generally, I didn&#x2019;t think they&#x2019;d be this ambitious</li></ul><p>On June 23rd, I learned enough Swift code to experience the interface in Xcode, and I started that post by saying:</p><blockquote>I am bouncing-off-the-walls excited about Apple Vision Pro. I&#x2019;m most excited about the opportunity to use the device to have multiple screens. I want to put my todo list on the wall beside me. I want to put a concert video on the wall in the corner as if I had a big TV. I want to have an infinite Figma canvas to play in. I&#x2019;ve even started fooling around with Swift and 3D rendering again so maybe I can make some simple apps. I have plenty of ideas of web experiments I&#x2019;d love to move into native code.</blockquote><p>On January 12th, a few weeks ago, someone asked what I thought of the product on Slack and I said:</p><blockquote>I believe we will look back and see that Apple cracked the code, just like with iPhone. To me, the dividing line is the pass through technology. I believe we will look back at pre-2024 headsets that have grainy, or laggy, or non-existent pass through and wonder wtf we were ever thinking.<br><br>I think we are going to realise that a) seeing the person&#x2019;s eyes b) them being able to see you, regardless of the software they&#x2019;re immersed in, is as table stakes as &#x201C;smartphones can&#x2019;t have physical keyboards&#x201D; or &#x201C;a trackpad or mouse is a requirement for any PC&#x201D;<br><br>Now &#x2014; it&#x2019;s super expensive and there are a kajillion things we need to wait and see. But as the meme on political Twitter goes: I&#x2019;ve seen enough. Every successful device like this in the future will have fantastic pass through.<br><br>I do think the eyes are going to look ridiculous, which is why they&#x2019;re hiding that part. (See also: video calls) And I agree the jury is out about how mainstream/cheap it can ever get.<br><br>But even if only 10 people ever use it, and it totally fails in the mainstream, that to me is evidence that the entire VR world will fail. Because this is the most human-centered, actually-solving-real-world-non-geek-problems attempt I&#x2019;ve seen.</blockquote><p>That is a good summary of how I felt, and how I still feel. But there was one more detail that&#x2019;s colouring my whole outlook here. The business angle.</p><blockquote>Oh, I forgot one detail: when I did my big VR pitch years back, there was one scenario I could genuinely see people getting excited about: live sporting events from great seats. I would bet good money that Apple will blow the doors open here. It&#x2019;s the clearest play I can see, and they&#x2019;ve been building there for years.</blockquote><p><strong>Live will be huge one day</strong></p><p><br>I&#x2019;ve spent many cycles thinking about VR, and how to actually make it cross into the mainstream. And the idea that you can watch a <em>live</em> sporting event from <em>the best seats in the house</em> is just staggering in its implication. Or what about the same thing for a Taylor Swift show (or your favourite artist)? Obviously being in the crowd surrounded by humans is the gold standard, for now. But we used to think Slack and text could never replace meetings at work and coffee with friends. Then we learned that the tech solutions are actually <em>better</em> in some contexts. One day, attending a concert virtually with a chat room of your friends from around the world will be seen as better in some ways than real world meet ups. Not &#x201C;sort of kind of nearly as good if you squint,&#x201D; I mean objectively better. It&#x2019;ll happen, and we&#x2019;re already seeing flickers of it.</p><p><strong>Predictions I got right and wrong</strong></p><p>Now that the reviews have come out, how&#x2019;d I do? What things was I right about, and what was I wrong about? Much like America itself, I think the good things are better than people give credit to, and the bad things are worse than they admit.</p><ul><li>I still think EyeSight is the defining feature, like iPhone having no keyboard. In time every product will consider this a table stakes feature.</li><li>I knew the eyes would look awkward, but they look more awkward than I expected.</li><li>I assumed the personas would look awkward, and they do. But much like the AirPods design or the original notch on iPhones, I think people will get acclimated to them faster than it might seem today.</li><li>I think the battery is a tempest in a teapot. Most people will stay plugged in rather than wandering around their house, so it&#x2019;ll mostly be a non-issue.</li><li>The weight sucks. It just does. Even in three years, it&#x2019;ll just be part of the price of admission, even as they shave off some grams here and there.</li><li>The interface is as close to perfection as we&#x2019;ve ever seen &#x2026; other than the software keyboard, which is horrible, as we&#x2019;ve come to expect from Apple.</li><li>The hardware design is obviously well done, surprising no one.</li></ul><p><strong>Beating Apple</strong></p><p>I don&#x2019;t think people truly understand how far ahead Apple is here, and how screwed their competition is. I worked at Microsoft and had an internal talk I&#x2019;d give called &#x201C;How To Beat Apple.&#x201D; In it, I explain that Apple&#x2019;s dominance in some areas is so total that there&#x2019;s no reasonable way to beat them head on. You can, however, beat them indirectly.</p><p>For Microsoft and Windows Phone, that meant hitting them in the Fortune 500 business use-cases, as well as the low end. For Google, it means search, but also online software in general, starting with search, and multiplied by their strength in emerging markets. For OpenAI, it means making assistants that Apple seem to be structurally incapable of competing with via their struggling Siri product. These are all winning strategies because it doesn&#x2019;t require getting high end purchasers to abandon the Apple vertically integrated ecosystem, and it aims efforts where Apple is weak. Apple is weak in many places! Aim there!</p><p>Yet people keep aiming where Apple is strongest, which is not smart. It&#x2019;s often overlooked in the nerd press, but people <em>like</em> their Apple hardware, and they <em>like</em> how Apple can make their hardware, software, and services to work well together. They don&#x2019;t mind how the App Store is really strict and they appreciate that Apple cares so much about privacy. These are all rational points of view for people trying to buy a product they can count on. So if you&#x2019;re going to dislodge them, you&#x2019;ve got quite a mountain to climb, starting with their tremendous lead in App Store selection and quality, multiplied by their tight vertical integration.</p><p>Windows Phone tried to climb the mountain with their own version of the App Store, by literally paying the top 100+ apps on iPhone to make products for Windows Phone. The developers made shitty ports of their popular iOS apps, pocketed the money, and barely updated the products beyond that. In the end, it didn&#x2019;t work. You can&#x2019;t buy your way to a thriving app ecosystem. There isn&#x2019;t enough money in the world. The tail is too long, and the moat is too wide.</p><p>Many people who will buy Apple Vision Pro aren&#x2019;t looking for another platform for Beat Saber, they&#x2019;re going to expect their favourite apps to work. Every single one. For me, it&#x2019;d be OmniFocus, Figma, Notational Velocity, and Ulysses. For someone else, it might be Garage Band, WhatsApp , and YouTube (the web version). Everyone has a different mix of apps that they care about, and only Apple will be able to let someone put an iOS app side by side with a macOS app, wrapped in a nearly perfect UX, so you have all the apps you need on day one. That&#x2019;s a hugely significant hurdle for any competitor, and no one will be able to match it.</p><p>Does that sound too strident? Does it rankle you a bit? At Microsoft, sure people hated to hear this. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s just software,&#x201D; people would retort. Or &#x201C;we&#x2019;re Microsoft, we always find a way to compete.&#x201D; Sure, fine. But some things transcend money or headcount. If I have an app that hasn&#x2019;t been updated in 7 years but it&#x2019;s absolutely vital to how I use my computer, Apple can offer this. No one else can. No one else will. The long tail is too long, and people want what they want. Or what about the command line? Any developer who uses a command line isn&#x2019;t thrilled about navigating a new App Store that will sell them a new command line tool that they then have to customise. They just want to load their existing terminal app, whether it&#x2019;s built into the Mac or it&#x2019;s provided by an indie Mac software developer. On Apple Vision Pro, they get what they want with no effort. On Oculus, the search for &#x201C;terminal&#x201D; returns zero results and &#x201C;<a href=""https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/search/?q=command+line&amp;ref=a-blog-about-jon-bell.ghost.io"">command line</a>&#x201D; returns 10 games that have nothing to do with the command line. No amount of effort, money, or developer outreach will change this. Either your product runs every app on day one, or it doesn&#x2019;t. If it doesn&#x2019;t, you can&#x2019;t &#x201C;catch up.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s not a solvable problem, because it&#x2019;s structural.</p><p><strong>But will Apple Vision Pro succeed?</strong></p><p>Look forward 3-5 years. The product will be lighter, the eyes will be less awkward, and the price will hopefully be cheaper. One of two things will be true: Apple Vision Pro has succeeded enough to justify continued development, or it hasn&#x2019;t. It&#x2019;ll be an Apple Watch or a G4 Cube.</p><p>In the case where it succeeds, I predict its competitors will make all the same mistakes of the past. They&#x2019;ll come up with a cheaper version of Apple&#x2019;s product and hope to make their profits in volume. It&#x2019;s a fine theory, but it doesn&#x2019;t work in practice. The idea that someone would say &#x201C;I love Apple Vision Pro, but I&#x2019;d rather lose all my favourite apps and the perfect interface so it can cost less with less build quality and I can play Beat Saber&#x201D; is a misread of the product positioning. Most people who wanted to tinker with VR have done it already, and most shrugged and walked away. If Apple Vision Pro succeeds &#x2014; and that&#x2019;s still to be seen &#x2014; it will be on the back of the spatial computing/apps angle, not the fact that it&#x2019;s another way to play Beat Saber. No one can compete where Apple Vision Pro excels, so even if a competitive product were $100 it still wouldn&#x2019;t work. The fact is, most people don&#x2019;t want VR in a new platform, segregated from their familiar apps and files. This is not because of price.</p><p>The other option is for Apple Vision Pro to fail, demonstrably proving that VR fails at the high end (even with apps), fails at the low end, and fails in the midrange. Apple is taking their best crack at this, letting money be no object, and propping it up with every strength they have. If it <em>still</em> can&#x2019;t find an audience despite the best App Store, the best hardware, the best latency, the best pass through, and the wealthiest customers, it means the market is a dead-end. It means we left no rock unturned but VR just isn&#x2019;t a thing people want, at least not in this form factor. Maybe in ten years when they&#x2019;re spectacles?</p><p>(But even then, people will expect it to work with their familiar apps. There is no world where someone wants their AR glasses to be a wholly other operating system with a wholly other App Store and no ability for the two to interact)</p><p>I don&#x2019;t think Apple Vision Pro will fail, though. Long time Apple watchers know how this story pans out. Version one is polished but limited, and always very very expensive. The 1984 Macintosh, the original laptops, the iMac, iPod, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods all started out that way. And then as the years go on, Apple iterates further, the mainstream starts to notice, the price comes down, and suddenly Apple is the mindshare and profit share leader.</p><p>It doesn&#x2019;t happen overnight, and it doesn&#x2019;t happen every time, but it usually does. And it will happen with Apple Vision Pro, because Apple is broadcasting exactly what they&#x2019;re doing to anyone who bothers to listen. They&#x2019;re not attempting to make VR. They&#x2019;re attempting to take everything they know about computing and slap it on your face. They&#x2019;re calling it &#x201C;spatial computing,&#x201D; but that&#x2019;s not a clever marketing term. It&#x2019;s a promise. And to their competition, who can&#x2019;t compete at that level, it&#x2019;s a threat.</p>",2024-01-31 21:49:48,üí¨,2191-1f46
